The tannin-rich brown water will carry you through old growth cedars into a very clean and fun granite canyon. While you're in the area, don't forget to check out the other Sayward highlights: White (III-V) and Middle Memekay (III+). Check out more details on these runs and others in an upcoming guidebook produced by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nThe Adam is a separate watershed, but the nearby gauge on the SALMON RIVER NEAR SAYWARD (08HD006) may give an idea of what is happening in the area. If you are making a trip to Sayward, this is one of the more flexible runs in terms of levels. To target a medium low flow, aim for 100cms on this gauge, less in the spring. The run accommodates water well and will be runnable at flows below and above this value, although it does turn into class IV at some point. The pool under the put in bridge can be deceptively calm even at good flows.\nThe Adam is just over an hour drive north of Campbell River on Highway 19. After crossing the Adam River highway bridge, turn right and follow Kim Creek Main and Rooney Main downstream on river left for ~4km to the put in bridge on your right. The takeout is ~7.5km further down Lower Adam Main, found by crossing the bridge, turning left, and heading downstream on river right. After passing through several clearcuts, look for two old logging spurs on your left just before a small creek. Turn left onto the second one, and drive ~1km through alders and small ditches to near the end of the spur. Hunt around here for a very rough trail that leads down to river level. The takeout eddy is very large and usually has many flood logs onshore up around the high water line.\nClose up map of the take out area.\nPaddling down from the put in, the run starts out slowly with a flatwater warmup into class II-III gravel bars and boulder gardens. About halfway through the run, it canyons up and the action remains fairly stacked class III+ boulder gardens and bedrock ledges right to the take out. Most rapids can be boat scouted, aside from the crux ledge (V-), which is an easy scout and portage on the left at an obvious horizon line. At high flows, it may be necessary to run a sneak line through the portage area. After paddling or seal launching into the runout of the crux rapid, a bit more whitewater quickly brings you to the takeout, a large eddy on the right that you should have scouted ahead of time. Continuing downstream to the confluence with the Eve River is not recommended due to a reportedly unrunnable falls.\nSkipping out of the crux ledge.\nThe runout of the crux ledge, which is representative of the difficulty of the rest of the run.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

You need cold and dry weather. If you commit to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0portaging Turnback, go in July-September.\nGauge\n164.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nContributed by Ali Marshall and Maxi Kniewasser\nKeep in mind this information is directed at kayakers using the Desadeash put in to paddle or portage Turnback Canyon, not the Tatshenshini-Alsek route that starts on the Tatshenshini. The Tatshenshini-Alsek confluence is well below Turnback Canyon, and lets rafting trips avoid an unmanageable or costly (helicopter) portage around the canyon.\nThe Alsek is one of the most spectacular wilderness runs in North America. The 265 km journey through the St. Elias Mountains, the highest coastal mountain range in the world, will take a group eight to ten days. The river travels through a Canadian Territory, a Canadian Province, and a US State. A testament to the majesty of the region is that one has to travel through three major parks - Kluane National Park in the Yukon Territories, Alsek-Tatshenshini Provincial Park in British Columbia, and Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska - in order to complete the trip. These parks have been designated together as a UNESCO world heritage site, being the largest protected area in the world covering 97,000 square km and containing the greatest ice caps in the world outside the poles.\nThe crux of the journey is Turnback Canyon, a harrowing section of class V+ whitewater. In 1971, Walt Blackadar at the age of 49 took on the first descent of the canyon by himself in August at high flows. The experience left him feeling lucky to be alive and he went on to describe the run as unpaddleable.\nSince the legendary first descent of Turnback Canyon several groups have managed to successfully paddle this section, but the ideal conditions for running the canyon are elusive. In 2016, glacial retreat in the headwaters of the Alsek resulted in the diversion of a large amount of flow into the drainage. The Kaskawulsh glacier previously fed both the Yukon and Alsek River watersheds via Slims Creek and the Kaskawulsh River, respectively. Since 2016 the glacier has retreated enough to no longer drain into Slims Creek, and now all of the meltwater has been diverted into the Alsek drainage. At the time of writing, the low-flow window for running the canyon is much shorter and in colder temperatures than in years preceding the flow change event.\nIn this harsh and unforgiving landscape you are hundreds of kilometers away from help. Not only are you likely to experience a high variety of savage weather conditions including maddening winds and rain, but the water is as close to freezing as imaginable. Previous multiday experience is an absolute must for anyone going on the trip, and every group member should be equipped for cold weather conditions. With some of the highest grizzly bear densities in the world, many beaches along the river look like bear highways, some of which you are not allowed to camp on. Be prepared for bear encounters. Those going on the trip but not running the canyon should still be competent class IV paddlers.\nHaines Junction (0 km) to Serpentine Creek (19 km)\nJust south of Haines Junction, the Alaska Highway crosses over the Dezadeash River, the logistically simpler put-in. The Dezadeash has an infinitesimally small gradient and a high potential for strong headwinds. Many rafting trips have put on 19 km downstream at the mouth of Serpentine Creek. In order to access this put-in, drive 10.6km north on the Alaska Highway and turn right on Nygren Subdivision Rd. Continue down this gravel road for 13km directly to the put-in. Dall's Sheep have been observed along the slopes in this section.\nKaskawulsh River confluence (27 km) to Lowell Lake (65 km)\nThe Dezadeash River quickly drains into the Kaskuwalsh River after the Serpentine Creek put-in to become the Alsek. This reach is mush wider, but still has no current and high winds. The remaining 38 km has several class II-III wavetrains, and Lowell Lake marks the end of this section. Next to this stunning iceberg speckeled lake is Goatherd Mountain, atop which is a great vantage point of the 65 km long Lowell Glacier and Mt Kennedy (4250 m). Hiking up is highly recommended to appreciate the view, and keep an eye out for mountain goats along the way.\nLowell Lake to Turnback Canyon (135 km)\nThe biggest rapids of the trip besides Turnback Canyon are on this section. 'Sam's Drop' (75 km) and 'Lava North' (79 km) are the two rapids of note (Class IV) that are both easy to scout. Grizzly encounters are common at these places, so scouting in groups, making noise, and keeping vigilant watch will help deter any run-ins.\nTurnback Canyon or the Portage\nTurnback Canyon has a wild and rugged feel to it. On one side is 2079 m Mount Blackadar, on the other side is the 11 km long terminal end of the Tweedsmuir Galcier, and within it lies some of the most committing big-water class V+ on the planet. In the past, several groups have taken 2 days to complete a portage of the canyon, but careful route selection can reduce travel time down to 5-6 hrs. The best place to begin the portage is right before the canyon walls appear on river right. There is a small beach from which the team can prepare for the hike. It is important to keep your group together whilst moving through the moraine in which hidden ice caves and small rock slides are not uncommon. Keep the alder brush to your left in sight as you hike up and down large deposits of terminal moraine, but do not enter into the brush. Once you come to and traverse the chain of small lakes that mark the halfway point of the portage, follow the outlet creek back down to river where you will find the last rapid of Turnback Canyon just downstream. A map of this route can be found below. Portaging the last rapid requires a committing ferry to the river left bank above the drop. The higher the water the more hairy the ferry, which may be challenging for weaker paddlers.\nTurnback Canyon to the Tatshenshini confluence (185 km)\nThere are a couple of class III+ rapids a few kms downstream of the canyon. The river valley then widens and provides a gentle float down to the Tatshenshini confluence.\nTatshenshini Confluence to Alsek Lake (242 km)\nThe nature of the landscape changes drastically in this section to a coastal type of mountain range, and the number of visible glaciers is astonishing. The spectacular Walker Glacier at the 208 km point is a great place to camp and explore. A day of flatwater later is the entrance to Alsek Lake, the largest glacial lake on the trip. The Grand Plateau and Alsek Glaciers release very large icebergs in to the lake, from house sized to Millenium Falcon sized. If weather conditions permit one can see Mt Fairweather to the east, which is BC's highest peak standing at 4671 m. Beware of rolling icebergs while exploring the lake and glacier calving activity while checking out the edge of glaciers. When large portions of ice are released, powerful waves are generated which travel long distances. Any gear left close the the lake's edge can be washed away by these waves, so stow equipment on high ground.\nAlsek Lake to Dry Bay (265 km)\nKeep in mind that there may be large icebergs either blocking or flowing down the outlet of Alsek Lake. There are a couple of easy to avoid class III rapids, one of which is a huge playwave for any aerial acrobats on the trip. Seventeen kilometers from the outlet of the lake there is a dried up side channel on river left which is sometimes marked. This is the take-out for the trip. From here it is a 2 km hike along the dried up channel to the ranger station/airstrip. An alternative take-out option is available at higher flows. Continue another 4 km downstream to where the side channel flows back into the main channel, and paddle up it for approximately 4 km right to the ranger station/airstrip. Using the secondary take-out access avoids having to hike your boat and gear, but is difficult to navigate will be dry at lower flows. The ranger station is closed after September and there is a small shelter adjacent to the airstrip. Bringing a day or two's worth of extra food would be prudent because of potential weather delays for the pickup flight, which are common in this area.\nPermits and Logistics\nGet to the city of Whitehorse, Yukon. The entire group must drive to Haines, Alaska and register with US customs. Leave a vehicle at the air strip. Drive to Haines Junction to put in. Fly from Dry Bay back to Haines.\nThe permit process is complicated and expensive. Click on the following link for detailed instructions.\nhttps://www.nps.gov/glba/planyourvisit/river-permit-application-and-guidelines.htm\nBasically:\n1. Apply for a takeout date through Yakutat Ranger Station (lottery system).\n2. Purchase you BC Parks permit.\n3.

Steep boulder piles that equate to difficult but good kayaking.\nClass\nV\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to moderate, at river level.\nTime\n2-3 hours.\nWhen to Go\nNo definite window - whenever water spills over the dam.\nGauge\n3.29cms\u2191 (Feb 14 11:44)\n!\nThe runnable season of this section changed permanently because of a hydro project that came online in November 2009. The season is now limited to the difficult-to-predict times when water spills over the dam. There are no recreational releases that provide a flow appropriate for this section.\nSimilar to other sections of the Ashlu, the Bottom Mile river bed was significantly altered by a major flood in November 2017. Many of the rapids are essentially unrecognizable from their previous version.\nThe Ashlu is truly a classic river. With section after section of diverse class IV-V whitewater, a long season and a tributary that represents one of the best day trips you'll find in the whole province, it really has no peer. The very last section of whitewater on the Ashlu is a furiously steep pile of boulders - it's not the best kayaking on the river, but it's well worth doing to run some fun rapids and to soak in the great scenery.\nThe Bottom Mile is good when the Ashlu is at low water. It used to be a reliable early/late season run, but now that the river is dewatered there is no seasonal window. It runs when a small amount of water spills over the dam; usually a flow of 6 to 10 cms on the\nonline gauge\nis good to go. It is possible to have a great flow when the gauge reads nothing (nominal fish flow of 2-5 cms) after a rain in the winter that only fills the low elevation tributaries below the dam and gauge. You can get down the river at higher flow too (for example, when the Box is running), but most people find it's just a series of difficult ferries back and forth between portages.\nThe closest town to the Ashlu is Squamish. From Squamish drive up the Squamish Valley, crossing over the Cheakamus River. Heading up the Squamish you'll eventually come to a big bridge on your left (the first one) over the river - this road gives access to the Ashlu Valley. The first thing you come to are twin bridges over the river - this can be your take out, or you can take out at the powerhouse just around the corner. To reach the put in, drive approximately 1.5 km up the steep hill and start at the first place the road comes close to the river. There is good parking near the flood warning siren. Remember, the river will look very low.\nAfter starting out and running some rocky rapids in a wide riverbed you'll pass the footing of an old bridge. This is the indicator you're getting to the first big rapid (the great 8 foot boof here changed to a rock jumble in the 2017 flood). Once you drop over you're deposited in the canyon and the big boulder action begins. When you get out to scout after this first rapid you'll be able to see the take out far below - the river is as straight as an arrow. From here down are many good boulder rapids and bedrock drops, some quite challenging. Expect a lot of scouting and relatively easy portaging. Most people will portage something. Finally, after the rapids end check the astounding view upriver - it's a good one, and a fitting end to a river that is nothing less than classic.\nStaging for one of the bigger rapids.\nClassic bedrock.

Possible when the dam spills over at times of high flow.\nGauge\n3.29cms\u2191 (Feb 14 11:44)\n!\nThe Box Canyon of the Ashlu is the signature class V kayak run of southwest BC. It is the epitome of boating in the area with an amazing valley, beautiful scenery and classic whitewater all locked down in a deep canyon. This legendary river was changed in late 2009 by the completion of a run-of-the-river hydro scheme - luckily there is a robust recreational whitewater release schedule so the river can still be enjoyed to the fullest, arguably as the most reliable, highest quality run in southwest BC.\nAccess to the Box is along dirt roads that are well maintained because of the power scheme. Head out of Squamish and up the Squamish valley. Shortly after the road turns to dirt take the bridge over the Squamish River to head up the Ashlu. Drive past the powerhouse and put in at the bridge over the river (stay right at the obvious fork). You can't miss it - the canyon starts just below the bridge. The take out is a few kilometers downstream - at the steep hill look for the avalanche path - there is ample space to pull over. Hike up this avalanche path from the river.\nFlows on the Box no longer follow a natural pattern because of the diversion. It is possible (and common) to paddle the river when there is too much water to be diverted at the height of summer snowmelt and in the fall after big rains. Outside of these unpredictable events there are up to 24 recreational whitewater releases each year on weekends in May, August and September.\nHere is a web page\ndetailing the release system from a kayaker's perspective.\nhe power company provides an online gauge for this river, and announce what flows are predicted to be when a release is to happen (via email - you have to sign up for the release to get this information). The definitive gauge for the Box is the visual staff gauge at put in bridge. 0.5 m is low, and 0.75 m is high. This corresponds to a range of approximately 16-32 cms on the online gauge - the correlation between the online gauge and the staff gauge is subject to some variability. It is doable at higher levels, but this is not recommended unless you are familiar with the run.\nThe Box Canyon comes out swinging. Upstream of the bridge there is a wide ledge called Last Tango that marks the end of the\nMine\n/Mini-Mine section of the Ashlu. Below the bridge is a 25-30 waterfall called 50/50 at the start of the canyon - it gets run all the time but it's not without several unpleasant consequences. You can start below this by taking a river left trail to where you can climb down to a granite platform that is next to the water.\nThe section below 50/50 deserves a scout from the canyon rim if you don't have a guide - there is an easy-to-follow trail along river left. The trail ends at Triple Drop, a multi-move rapid that can't be scouted or portaged at river level. Below Triple Drop things open up a bit until the canyon ends in a wide gravel bed. The second part of the canyon starts with a long entrance rapid followed by a double drop and then a rapid that is easiest dealt with along the left side. You'll know you've reached the take out when you pull up to a huge horizon line. This is the start of section between the Box and the\nBottom Mile\nthat rarely gets run.\nEnjoy this slice of BC splendor. Be careful and have fun!\nGreg Dashper at 50-50.\nOne of the put ins if you're not in to running 50-50.\nEntrance boof.\nIn the heart of the Box Canyon.\nTriple Drop.\nTriple Drop, shot upstream from the top of the next rapid.\nThe double drop.

Tough river level portaging possible in most spots.  One or two must-run rapids.\nTime\n2-4 hours.\nWhen to Go\nJuly through early September.\nGauge\n3.29cms\u2191 (Feb 14 11:44)\n!\nThe Mine Run on the Ashlu is one of the sleeper classics in the Squamish zone. While it lacks the huge vertical walls of the Box Canyon downstream it has just as many clean bedrock rapids, and the meat of the run has been left unaffected by the completion of the Ashlu hydro project. The Mine has a well deserved, ferocious reputation - it is an excellent section of class IV-V kayaking studded with big holes you have to punch and a stout portage or two. This run fits the BC whitewater stereotype perfectly.\nThe typical Mine Run season is in July and August. Be wary dropping in here early in the summer - while the Mine Run tolerates high water quite well, it does get too high. At boatable high levels it is an all out class V bar fight and it can be a real handful if you're unfamiliar with it. High levels can be gauged using the\nInnergex gauge\nfor flows in the river downstream of the dam. 5-10 cms on that gauge (10 over the dam + the 30 they divert for a total of 40 in the Mine) is medium/medium high. 20+ cms (50+ total) on that gauge is high water. If the Innergex gauge is just showing the fish flow (~2.5 cms) the Mine will be at a medium level or lower. The Ashlu can also be loosely correlated to the Elaho - if the\nElaho gauge\nis below 100 cms the Mine Run is probably low.\nMine Run access is via rough dirt roads that are slightly overgrown. You'll need clearance but you don't need 4x4. Drive up the Ashlu and set your take out vehicle at the dam. On rare occasions it's still possible to continue on downstream through the\nBox Canyon\n(release days, high water days). You can only get to the top using the river right logging roads as the bridge over 50/50 was closed to vehicle traffic in the fall of 2016. The river right access puts you in below the worst part of the Mine rapid. Drive the river right road until it ends at an old mining camp. To get to the river walk over the small creek and follow the old road trending right down to the old mine - at the mine shaft drop straight down to the water. The river left access used to start above the entirety of the Mine rapid, and a few nice rapids above that.\nFrom the upper (river left) put in the river is wide class II. Some good ledges lead quickly to the Mine rapid. This is a major rapid with a huge river-wide hole about half way down. You can portage on the left around the hole and put back in to a small eddy. You can't carry the bottom of the rapid, so head over to river right to scout the bottom half. The river right eddy below the portage is the lower (river right) access point. Whatever side you decide to enter by this rapid presents a stout entrance to this section of river.\nBelow here the river is largely pool-drop bedrock ledges with some sections of boogie. Scout as necessary. After 5 or 6 big rapids a creek will enter on river right at a point where the river bends left. Walk 50 meters up the creek and follow the flagging tape and a faint but improving trail around a terrible pinch rapid - there are ropes in place to help lower back to the river - expect 15 minutes to complete this portage. There is a shorter portage by catching a marginal eddy further down from the creek - this is not recommended.\nAfter you get in there are more great rapids down to the old Mini-Mine put in, and all too quickly you'll be in the pond above the dam. Despite the hard work this is an excellent section of river - enjoy it and spread the word.\nIt's called the Mine Run because - you guessed it - there's an old mine at the put in.\nBottom half of the Mine rapid.\nA huge hole.  There are many big holes on the Mine.\nAnother Mine classic.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Expect a lot of fallen trees and overgrowth on the road. \u00a0 You can lessen the walk by a few km by parking near the Innergex Dam at the end of the Mine run, ferrying across and then walking up from there.\u00a0 Depending on fitness this may take you 2+ hours, and for added fun unless you feel like paddling the\nMine Run\nbelow you'll be walking out for 4-5km as well!\u00a0 Using an e-bike to shoulder boats can be good as long as the road has been cleared recently.\nLevel:\nThere is no gauge above the dam on the Ashlu so level inspection is visual, if there's flow coming over the dam (above 5cm/s) then it's probably a medium-high flow.\nDescription (From Claudia's Book from 2006)\nThe extended version of the run adds a couple of steep class III/III+ drops before arriving at the bridge and the lower put-in. The first half of the run is a scenic float with small II-III drops, the second half of the run is III+ with a couple of IV- drops (the first significant drop starts where the river makes a slight left turn and squeezes between two big boulders). The take-out is shortly after an island at a gravel bar on the left.\u00a0 The spot is usually clearly marked with flagging tape, but if it's your first time you may want to walk down prior to the run.\u00a0 Plan 20-30 minutes for the trail up to where you parked.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Access is straightforward: drive up the Ashlu Road from the Squamish Valley, don\u2019t take the turn to 50-50, continue for about 2km until there is a sharp right turn down to the dam. Park at the junction, gate access is required at all times to the dam. Walk down the road to the dam and follow the portage signs to the right around the fencing and put on just below the dam. (there is no spillway to paddle here). The take out is at the 50-50 bridge just above the Box Canyon section, a large horizon line looms.\nBecause this reach is below the dam, the reading on the gauge reports exactly the amount of water you'll have. It can be paddled when the river is overtopping the dam during spring and the first half of summer or in late summer and fall during releases on the Box Canyon (typically 20-30cms). It\u2019s been run as low as 7cms but 25cms is a good flow. If you go in spring when the dam is overflowing you may be lucky enough to paddle this section up to 90cms; at higher flows, it becomes solid class 4+.\nMost of the river is read and run for any experienced class 4 boaters.\u00a0 It finishes with the Last Tango waterfall which is worth inspecting from the 50-50 bridge at the takeout before starting your run.\nFor those that want a bit more detail, from the start enjoy some boogie rapids until the river bends to the left with a large square rock in the middle.\u00a0 You can jump out on river right and take a quick look at the right slot drop or run the easier line to the left side of the boulder.\nJames Hamilton sending the right slot\nThe right is a nice clean boof which gets harder as the rivers get higher and generally creates some chaos.\nAshlu classic blue water day\nBelow there is a nice long flat pool section before you enter into the longest rapid of this section. The river bends to the right, start middle then stay right, thread through some rocks back to center and get to a chunkier drop which requires a bit of a boof.\nStandard Mini-Mine read and run\nThe deceptively meaty hole ahead\nBelow there is a little curler wave which often pushes people into the rock on the right so drive left as you take the right line.\nWork your way back to the river left and enter another bedrock constriction, which at higher flows is stickier on the left but ends in another pool.\nTypical bedrock constriction ending in a pool\nThe next rapid has a sneaky line on the right with a nice diagonal boof or can be run easier on the left channel, both lines lead into another constriction rapid which gets boily on the left at higher flows again ending in a nice pool.\nOptional right channel with fun boof\nAnother boulder garden rapid follows where you enter right and drive left, and before you know it you\u2019re in an eddy above Last Tango.\u00a0 Enter in river-middle and aim your boat at the right side of the bridge below.\u00a0 It\u2019s very easy to get pulled to the left here and run down the seam line of the double drop which can dish out a beating. Caution, if someone was to swim here they would not have long to get out before 50-50, and there\u2019s a reasonably high chance their boat may enter the box canyon. So if you don\u2019t have a solid roll it is probably best to take out on the right above the falls. When the river is high take out before the bridge on the right.\nMatthew Houston running Last Tango\nThere is also another line down the far right of the falls which is a low-volume double-drop.\nHamish Dobson on the right line\nTake out immediately below the bridge and go inspect 50-50 and hopefully watch someone sending it or it's time to head back up to the put-on and run another lap of this superb high-quality short section!\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Fast laps on the lower 6 km take 30 min.\nWhen to Go\nEarly season high water snowmelt in May/June.\nGauge\n1.89cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:10)\n!\nThe Ashnola River is a stream located in the Okanagan region of BC, an area not often associated with whitewater kayaking. Rising across the border in the US, the Ashnola drains Cathedral Provinical Park and flows north to join the Similkameen River near the town of Keremeos. The Ashnola is a unique river with moderate continuous class IV whitewater for miles that appeals to a wide range of boaters. The added bonus is the location in the Okanagan often means hot and sunny weather when the river is running.\nThere is an accurate\nonline gauge for the Ashnola\n. The river only flows from snowmelt in the spring and early summer in May and June. In very large snow years it's possible to stretch the season into July. The river has a wide runnable range - 20 cms is low water. The medium flow sweet spot when the river starts to shine is at 35 cms, where it is a really fun continuous class IV section of whitewater. The run is roadside and it tolerates high flows well but the difficulty and issues associated with a very continuous river increase accordingly. Flows of 50+ cms are starting to move beyond the class IV range. There is a stump in the river at the take out camp site that can be used as a visual gauge as well (photo below).\nThe Ashnola is found a few km west of Keremeos on the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3). The easiest way to find your way to the whitewater is to follow the signs for Cathedral Provincial Park. Follow the road into the park. There is a great campsite at the 0 km marker (the first point the river is close to the road) where you'll also find the gauge stump. The furthest upstream put in is about 20 km up. You can access the river wherever you like - other popular put in points are at the 12 km and the 6 km markers. There is good camping all along the road up the river.\nThe general character of the Ashnola is continuous low to medium volume class IV rapids. It is all easily boat scoutable, and the run increases in difficulty as you go further down the river. Groups can start and stop at many locations along the length of the run, made easy by the fact the road is usually right next to the water. For reference, the Ashnola is a notch easier than the\nUpper Cheak\nin Whistler. The 20 km to 12 km access is the easiest stretch. Somewhere below the 12 km marker a significant tributary enters and the rapids become more interesting. At the 6 km marker is the largest rapid on the run called Sabertooth - it's easily visible on the shuttle. Excellent class IV rapids continue from here all the way to the take out. Running laps on the bottom 6 km are the best bang for your buck. Smash some laps and then kick back and enjoy the great camping!\nFantasy Island, located at km 12, is one of the bigger rapids in the upper part of the river.\nSabertooth rapid, the biggest one on the river, at the 6 km marker.\nUpstream view looking at the run out of Sabertooth.\nNear the start of the bottom 6 km, approaching one of the best boofs on the run.\nTypical Ashnola.\nOkanagan scenery.\nAshnola boogie.\nNear the end of the run.

Big water on the Skeena.\nClass\nIII+-IV\nScouting / Portaging\nMost rapids can be scouted and portaged.\nTime\n3-4 days (150km)\nWhen to Go\nMay \u2013 October.  Early summer for the most fun\nGauge\n0.252m\u2193 (Oct 21 05:55)\n!\nThe Babine river is a fantastic wilderness multiday trip.\u00a0 Draining Babine lake, its flows through the Babine River Corridor Provincial Park for 95km until joining the Skeena River.\u00a0 Downstream of this confluence, to the community of Kispiox, contains 55km of awesome \u2018Big Water\u2019 class 3 (some class 4 at high water).\u00a0 During the month of August, a huge Sockeye Salmon run swims up the Babine.\u00a0 There are \u2018A LOT\u2019 of Grizzlies in this area.\u00a0 At the largest rapid on this section suitably named \u2018Grizzly Drop\u2019, there have been a dozen bears spotted at one time.\u00a0 Be bear aware.\n0.5m \u2013 1.9m is the known\u00a0 range of flow.\u00a0 This run can be paddled at flood,\u00a0 the rapids are class 4 but the consequence of a swim is severe.\u00a0 The Skeena can run at 3000cms at these levels.\u00a0 The quality of this run is better during the spring and early summer.\u00a0 The late summer trips are more mellow but can feel a little slow.\nDirections\nPut-in\nFrom Smithers drive east along Hwy16, cross the bridge over the Bulkley river, pass Old Babine Lake Road on your left and continue 3.5km to Babine Lake Road.\u00a0 Turn left onto Babine Lake Road and drive approximately 55km to Nilkitkwa FSR which is just past Doris Lake.\u00a0 Turn left (North) onto Nilkitkwa FSR and drive approximately 60km, staying on the main road at junctions, to the bridge over the Babine River just downstream of the outlet of Nilkitkwa Lake.\u00a0 Just before the bridge, turn right and drive 0.4km to the put-in at the boat launch immediately downstream of the of the fish counting weir.\nTake out\nThe ideal take-out is the confluence of the Skeena and Kispiox rivers in the community of Kispiox.\u00a0 Directions are as follows:\u00a0 From Hwy 16 in New Hazelton, turn North at the tourist information center onto Hwy 62/Kispiox Road.\u00a0 This turnoff is signed to Historic Old Hazelton and Ksan Village.\u00a0 Follow the road 6km across one-lane Hagwilget Bridge to Kispiox Valley Rd.\u00a0 Turn right onto Kispiox Valley Rd and drive 13,5km, crossing the Skeena River and Kispiox River bridges.\u00a0 In Kispiox, turn right on Sim Gii Gyat Avenue, following signs to the Totem poles.\u00a0 Follow this road 0.7km to the totem poles and river right bank of the Skeena river.\nThe shuttle is long.\u00a0 Its awesome if you can find a shuttle driver.\nAlternate Take out\u2019s\nFor a shorter paddle but massive shuttle you can take out at the confluence of the Babine and Skeena River.\u00a0 You will miss the quality whitewater on the Skeena.\u00a0 Drive towards Kispiox (description above), 3.5km after turning onto Kispiox Valley Rd turn right onto Salmon River Rd.\u00a0 Follow this Rd for 60km till you reach the bridge over the Babine, take out is on river right.\u00a0 After 9km the road changes name from Salmon River Rd to Babine Slide FSR.\nFor a longer paddle (15km past Kispiox) but shorter shuttle take out at Anderson Flats Provincial Park.\u00a0 From New Hazelton, take Hwy 16 towards Terrace for 3.7km then turn right onto Omineca Ave.\u00a0 After 700m turn right onto Hazelton Station Road.\u00a0 Follow for 1.5km until you reach the Anderson Flats on the Skeena River.\nDescription\nThe river starts off gently.\u00a0 After 4hrs of class 2\u00a0 you reach the confluence of Shelagyote Creek. \u00a0 Depending on how far you want to paddle on day 1 this is a good camp option.\u00a0 1hr downstream the whitewater starts to pick up.\u00a0 1hr of fun read and run leads you to the beautiful Waterfall Camp recognizable from the waterfall on river left and huge canyon wall on river right.\u00a0 45mins down form this camp is the well named Grizzly drop (class 4).\u00a0 Scout on river left.\u00a0 Beware of Grizzly bears, there have been a dozen bears spotted here during the salmon run.\u00a0 45mins down stream lies Sphincter 1 and 2 drops (Class 3/4 constrictions), scout on river right.\u00a0 Shortly after is Kisgegas Canyon, a fun class 3 canyon with some narrow gaps and ledges.\u00a0 1hr down stream is the confluence of the Skeena.\u00a0 There is good camping here or 20mins further is a fantastic camp on the down stream end of an island on the Skeena.\u00a0 It is approximately 5-6hrs to the community of Kispiox.\u00a0 The section holds some fantastic big volume class 3 with some great play waves (a few large holes at high water).\nThe takeout is on river right immediately upstream of the mouth of the Kispiox River close to a large field with totem poles.\nContributed by Ali Marshall and Tania Millen\nEntrance to Kisgegas Canyon Photo Ezra Brousseau\nScouting Grizzly Drop Photo Ezra

It also has a perfect progression to warm up on.\nClass 2 whitewater and pretty canyon walls\nStarting with a few km of class I moving water (a bit bony) it slowly builds through a few class II rapids with eddies and boulders to get a feel for current changes, a class III, then a longer class III+ rapid before arriving at a horizon line worth a scout.\nThis is a class IV drop during the early spring flows I have seen it at. Almost immediately downstream comes a superb class IV/IV+ double drop.\nThe view directly upstream of the double drop\nBack to back 10 foot waterfalls with perfect lips and lots of water to plant your boof stroke on. This double drop is scouted on the right which gives a perfect view of the 1st drop, however, since the canyon pinches together so tightly and vertically, it is difficult to see the landing of the 2nd drop. It is cleanest center-right and the boils from the 1st drop want to push you into the right wall.\nPure Gold\nHigh water could make for some scary holes here. Portaging the double drop takes a little bit of work and steep bushwhacking.\nA good view of the double drop. The canyon walls go straight up on either side of the 2nd drop making scouting and portaging slightly more complicated.\nThe runout has a few more small rapids and fun eddies.\nLooking downstream toward the runout after the double drop. As you can see this river runs early and cold!\nLooking downstream toward the runout after the double drop. As you can see this river runs early and cold!\nWhile the Beaver does not have a huge amount of whitewater and might feel a bit scrapy and low at the start, it is well worth it for an early season run. An easy warm up with a couple of very satisfying and confidence inspiring boofs to finish it off.\nThe Beaver is best run in the spring when the double drop is in. High water would most likely result in portaging the best part of this run. The portage involves a bit of steep bushwhacking and is easiest with a friend.\nSpringtime melt means the road to the put in gets pretty soft and rutted. 4x4 or all wheel drive with ok clearance is recommended.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

      "full_text": "BCWhitewater\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nAbout\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact\nBecome a member\nBedwell River\nContributed by Scott McBride\nWhat It's Like\nA hike in multiday through the heart of Vancouver Island\nClass\nIV+ (P)\nScouting / Portaging\nScouting is reasonable with some effort. Approximately 4 portages.\nTime\n1 very long day to hike in, 2 more days to paddle out\nWhen to Go\nSpring snowmelt May-June\nGauge\n119.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:15)\n!\nThe Bedwell River is the premiere multiday mission on Vancouver island, with a very challenging hike in to run a short section of beautiful whitewater through a remote area of Strathcona Provincial Park. Expect to push your physical and mental limits, and to be rewarded by some classic whitewater that is (maybe) worth the hike. The hike/bushwhack takes at least 12 hours to cover 12km, and includes significant elevation change and route finding. The river section is only about 20km, and is comparable in length and difficulty to a Gordon River triple crown. This run was pioneered by island legend Shayne Vollmers.\nFlows\nLook for the Gold (GOLD RIVER BELOW UCONA RIVER (08HC001)) to be around 100cms off snowmelt for a nice medium low level on the Bedwell, which can usually be found during spring snowmelt in May or June, depending on the snow year.\nPacfish also maintains a staff gauge on the lower Bedwell River. Good levels may be between 0.6-1.0m, however this gauge is not regularly calibrated.\nShuttle\nThe shuttle is 5 hours each way, so you are going to want to find a shuttle driver or two. Start the hike at Bedwell Lakes trailhead in Strathcona Provincial Park, found past the south end of Buttle Lake, by branching off BC Highway 28 NW of Campbell River. Takeout is by chartered water taxi from the Bedwell River mouth to Tofino, at the terminus of BC Highway 4.\nHike In\nHike up the Bedwell Lakes Trail switchbacks, up at least 400m elevation gain, topping out at a 950m high pass in the subalpine. Depending on snow and ice conditions, either cross Baby Bedwell and Bedwell Lakes, or else route find around the east side of the lakes. After this comes the most difficult part of the trip, a faintly marked route descending the river left side of the uppermost Bedwell River valley down to a huge landslide and avalanche path. If you find the dangerous log crossing of K2 Creek, you are on the right track. You will probably reach the avalanche path late on one of the hottest afternoons of the spring, but will be too tired to care about the overhead hazard. There is a small rocky camp on the far side that is just outside of the path. Not far below here, an overgrown and washed out logging road leads the rest of the way to the put in at 250m elevation, on river left just above You Creek. Between the landslide and the normal You Creek put in is exploratory class V whitewater.\nOn the water\nBelow You Creek is several kilometres of braided class I-II full of wood, and excellent camp options. After a small pond, the whitewater begins but quickly leads to the first portage around a stout drop that often has wood, best portaged on river right along the overgrown logging road. The rest of the whitewater is mostly class III-IV, with a few harder rapids mixed in, and about four normal portages to look out for in total. The final portage is around Bedwell Falls, best portaged on river left around a series of gnarly drops. From the foot bridge the river eases off to class I-II down to the estuary with more great camp options. Clayoquot Wilderness Resort is located on river right near the river mouth and includes several private lots and crown tenures. A potential water taxi pickup spot is on a small beach just past their private dock. Then it's a short cruise to some well deserved beer and tacos in Tofino.\nStarting the hike at the Bedwell Lakes trailhead.\nHiking up the Bedwell Lakes trail.\nCrossing Baby Bedwell Lake.\nCrossing Bedwell Lake.\nPaddling around the edge of Bedwell Lake.\nThe \"descent\"\nArriving at the landslide late in the evening.\nLooking back up the slide path on a bigger snow year.\nHiking down to the river.\nPut in on river left of Bedwell River just above You Creek confluence.\nBraided class I-II below You Creek.\nMariner Mountain\nLooking back up at the first portage.\nTwin Falls\nThe runout of the second portage.\nThe Fold\nLooking down into the third portage, a river wide sieve.\nOne of several boulder garden sections towards the end.\nStarting the fourth portage around part of Bedwell Falls.\nThe main part of Bedwell Falls waiting for a first descent.\nFinishing the fourth and final portage around Bedwell Falls.\nStaff gauge on the lower Bedwell River at low but fun level of 0.6m.\nUrsus Creek\nClayoquot Wilderness Lodge dock with a possible water taxi pickup point at the beach on the left/south.\nBedwell river mouth land tenures from ImapBC.\nPulling into the government dock in Tofino.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Spring snowmelt possible\nPart of the Alice Lake zone in the far reaches of northern Vancouver Island, the Lower Benson should hold water fairly well as it is fed by a series of small lakes. However, this is a questionable run with little whitewater and several hazards, primarily caves in the Quatsino Limestone. With extreme care you can explore these cave systems from your kayak at low to medium flows. Other rivers in the zone are the Marble and Link Rivers.\nFlows\nThe Benson River has several small lakes which should regulate flow somewhat throughout the winter and spring. However, the Lower Benson should only be attempted at low to medium water in between winter rain events. The river is likely runnable from October through June in the right conditions.\u00a0 Recommended flows are between 10-20cms, but this will be difficult to estimate with no active gauge and most access points starting on lakes. At very low water portions of the river are reported to flow entirely underground. It's possible to explore around the Devil's Bath Recreation Site to get a feel for the flow through the first canyon.\nBENSON RIVER NEAR PORT ALICE (08HE003). Historical flow data from a limited record from 1925-1931. Recommended flows are ~10-20cms.\nShuttle\nTo get to the river, take the north island highway past Port McNeill, turn west on Highway 30 (The Frigon Road) towards Port Alice. After passing Marble River Provincial Park, but before reaching Port Alice, turn left onto the Southeast Main and follow this ~6km to the Link River Campground, a possible takeout. Follow the Southeast Main and the Alice Lake Main up the river left side of the Benson River to the Devils Bath Recreation Site, to scout the first canyon and check the level. From here, either continue upstream to Kathleen Lake Recreation Site to put in on river left, or circle back to the river right to put in at the other end of Kathleen Lake near the Eternal Fountain.\nOn the water\nFrom either end of Kathleen Lake, paddle 2km to the lake outlet between limestone bluffs. Shortly below the lake, a class III rapid pushes into an undercut wall river right which most likely has a cave tunnel. Around the bend under a set of powerlines, flow appears to emerge from this tunnel at a questionable ledge drop with an old growth log. Even without the log, this area appears constricted and suspiciously little water is flowing on surface, so portaging on the right is recommended. Approximately 100m downstream of the powerlines on river left is the mapped sink for the Devil's Bath cave system, where water flows into the subsurface cave system to join the cenote. Needless to say, stay away from every wall on this run. Just after this headwall, it is possible to eddy out on river left and explore a dry cave. There is a pinch rapid in this section that is the crux of the first canyon (class III+ at medium flows), and if there is a problem with wood or something else it should be possible to escape with difficulty up the caver trails to the Devils Bath parking lot. Below the pinch, it is possible to paddle up into the outlets of the cave system, a highlight of the run. After a couple more class III rapids, the canyon opens up, and if you can explore for a takeout in this area to the nearby road, this first canyon could be paddled very carefully at the class III+ level.\nBelow the first canyon, the river eases off for several km, but just as you expect to reach Alice Lake a horizon line appears. This is the second canyon, a committing class V zone with a lot of unstable rockfall debris. The first significant ledge, Boof or Consequences, has a clean boof in the centre surrounded by undercuts. Portaging or hiking out appears difficult at this point, and once you boof the ledge you are committed to running or portaging the crux, the Green Monster. Three major ledges of varying runnability funnel into an ugly limestone headwall at the bottom. The portage is on river right over unstable rockfall debris, putting in within the sieve pile at the bottom. But wait, there is still a hairy ferry to get out of the eddy, through the outwash of the rapid and just escaping the wall. This section has a lot of objective risk, probably comparable to the Cayoosh Creek landslide rapid, or maybe higher. Once past the crux, there is one more fun rapid and then the river eases off down to Alice Lake and your campsite.\nThe Eternal Fountain.\nKathleen Lake outlet.\nThe first bend out of the lake. It's pretty likely that some water shortcuts through the bend underground.

Spring snowmelt possible\nSure, every river has a triple drop. But what if there was a river with three triple drops, and that was the whole run? Welcome to the Upper Benson, an aesthetically pleasing canyon that is too short to be worth the drive unless you happen to be taking the back road to Port Alice.\nFlows\nThere are no gauges in this area, but the Upper Benson is a tight low volume creek, and low winter flows are probably best for a safe descent. At the put in, it should look like just enough flow to kayak. Any sort of big rain spike or high flows is going to be class V. This portion of the Benson River is above all the lakes, so flows may be flashy as is typical for the island. Furthermore, the Vanishing River is subtracted through a cave above the Upper Benson, and transferred to the Reappearing River into the Raging River. None of that water flows through this reach.\nShuttle\nTo get to the put in, drive north on the island highway to just beyond Port McNeill, and turn left on the Keogh FSR to a bridge at 35.5km. The takeout is ~2km downstream on river left along another FSR near Merry Widow Mountain.\nOn the water\nMost, but not all of the rapids can be scouted at river level; those that cannot can be scouted and presumably portaged on river left above the low canyon walls. There are a few points that feel committing, and although the road is close to the left a hike out will probably involve a healthy bushwhack. If this run is full of wood it will be a lot of work to scout, but in 2022 it was totally clean. Although the rock is mostly limestone, the cave factor does not appear to be in play, but there is some pin/piton factor. The character is somewhat reminiscent of the in between boogie rapids on the Cameron River. Take out once the road reappears on river left, or a bit further downstream at a bridge to the Raging River IPP.\nThe first set from the air.\nLooking down into the first set.\nLooking down into the second set.\nThe crux of the run in the middle of the second set.\nLooking back up the second set.\nThe third set is the easiest.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

In the Lower Big Creek section described here, below Farwell Canyon Road, the river drops off the edge of the volcanic plateau through a dramatic, unrunnable canyon. Below the canyon, ~15km of steep, scrappy, continuous, bouldery, and sometimes dangerous whitewater follows down to the confluence with the Chilcotin River. The whitewater is not classic, but this rarely visited semi-arid canyon is unusual for BC. Picture the Ashnola River, but with lower quality whitewater and difficult access, or maybe the unloved sibling of the Hurley River. The reason to come here is for a bite sized 50km mission off the beaten path. If Big Creek is running, it is likely that the nearby class III-IV classics on the Chilko, Taseko, and Chilcotin rivers will be running at excellent high water levels.\nFlows\nIn most years the thin alpine snowpack melts off early during May and June, possibly extending into July. While there are small glaciers in the alpine headwaters, they are not big enough to sustain runnable flows through the summer. In some years (e.g. 2019), major summer thunderstorms can hit the Chilcotin Plateau, and the large area of this plateau can lead to flooding, but in most years this run will be done by July. The information here is from a descent at 12cms in July 2020 (\nBIG CREEK ABOVE GROUNDHOG CREEK (08MB006)\n), which was a low runnable flow. Below 10cms is not recommended, and while flows up to 20cms may improve the quality of some of the whitewater, the added push may put some of the canyons into the V+ range. Keep in mind that the gauge is upstream of several diversions for agriculture and wetlands, which may influence the actual flow in this reach.\n2020 hydrograph for and historical averages for Big Creek. 10-20cms probably represents the runnable flow window.\nShuttle\nAccess to the take out is one hour out of Williams Lake, by following Highway 20 west for 46km, turning left onto the Farwell Canyon Road (unpaved), and following this 22km down into the Chilcotin River canyon. There are several take out options near the Farwell Canyon bridge, a common one being near the old cabin on river right. To get to the put in, continue along Farwell Canyon Road up and out of the canyon for another 34km, staying right at the Y, until reaching the Erickson Bridge over Big Creek. Much of the land near the put in is private property outside of the road right of way. There are alternate put in options downstream of this bridge which cut out flatwater, but these involve route finding and 4x4 driving in sticky mud. It should be possible to evacuate to Farwell Canyon Road on river right from any point during the run, as it is never further than 5km away cross country to the SE, but this would be a last resort.\nOn the water\nFrom the bridge, the first ~20km is mellow class II-III whitewater traversing the fields and small forests of the Chilcotin Plateau. There are some logjams and small canyons, but with some luck you shouldn't have to get out of your boat. IMPORTANT - At some point (approximately\n51.78594, -122.77957)\n, you need to get out for a mandatory portage around a huge, unrunnable canyon. In the next section the creek drops over 100m in less than 1km, and is totally boxed in with vertical volcanic rock walls. The start of this canyon is not obvious, and looks very similar to the other small runnable canyons upstream. It is recommended to get out on river left when the walls are only ~5m high. The portage itself is about 1km long, and is relatively easy along the river left canyon rim, through grassy meadows and open burned forest. Take an occasional peek into the impressive canyon below, then follow a manageable scree slope back down to river level at the end of the canyon. Make sure to walk over and take a look back up into the exit of the canyon. Below this portage is the bulk of the runnable whitewater in this section, ~15km of steep bouldery class IV-V whitewater that never really gets quality. There are no notable rapids, but the crux may be a middle section where the river passes through a series of winding, unstable canyons. Many scouts and portages are on very unstable and dangerous landslide material and large loose blocks. Wood is in play, including around blind corners and in steep class V rapids. At some points, portaging up and out of the inner canyon becomes a tempting option. Just when you think it's pointless, the last ~4km clean up into a fast, technical, and fun read and run class IV section down into the Chilcotin River, which then dumps you straight into Big Creek Rapid, a long class III wave train and one of the fastest rapids out there. There are reports of paddlers on a Chilcotin trip stopping to camp at Big Creek, hiking upstream from the confluence and paddling this lower read and run section, which is the only good part of the creek anyhow. This lowermost read and run class IV section could handle more water than the rest of the creek. The ~15km on the Chilcotin River down to the takeout at Farwell Canyon should take less than an hour.\nDon't say you're not at least a little bit curious.\nMellow floating across the Chilcotin Plateau\nAt the start of the portage along the river left canyon rim.

The head pond does not impact the popular Upper Big Silver run.\nLevel\nThere is an\naccurate online gauge\nfor the Middle Big Silver, making the long drive to get there more palatable. We don't know what flow is best for this section. Innergex provides up to 4 days of releases per year (in July and August) at a flow of 15 cms, which seems like it would be a good flow. You need to sign up, similar to the Ashlu system, for a release to happen. It should also be possible to run this section when there is some water spilling over the dam during peak snowmelt. The season for this run before the dam was in late summer and early fall.\nDirections\nGo to Harrison Hot Springs and take the Harrison East FSR up the east side of Harrison Lake. The kilometers are well marked the whole way. When you reach Big Silver Creek, the Harrison East FSR will begin to head up the Big Silver Valley. The reference point for the Middle canyon is where the big bridge on the Harrison East FSR crosses from river left to river right at approximately km 47 (give or take). The put in is at the dam upstream from the bridge. The take out is downstream of the bridge at the power house.\nRiver\nThe Middle Big Silver is a serious stretch of whitewater in a committing granite gorge. The easier half of the run is upstream of the bridge where it seems straightforward. Just below the bridge as the river bends left is the crux of the run. Get out here if you have to as it will be difficult or impossible downstream. Several class V rapids lead in to a very marginal waterfall that to my knowledge hasn't been run. The portage looks horrible, and you should scout the gorge before you commit to make sure you want to deal with this drop and the portage. More rapids lead to a triple falls. The first two also look marginal and haven't been run (again, as far as I know) - portage and run the last one. It's a short paddle to easy water and the take out at the power house.\nKeep in mind this river beta is from an extensive scout, not a descent. We deemed it was too much dealing to run just a few good rapids.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

A tributary of Big Silver Creek (Shovel Creek) above the Upper is also under direct threat, but the project is currently on hold.\nUpper Big Silver Creek is a fun section of whitewater hidden away deep in the southern Coast Mountains, flowing directly into Harrison Lake. While it's out of the way from pretty much anything, and there are limited other paddling options close by, it is a worthwhile destination as the area is beautiful and the moderate paddling combined with deep box canyons and clear green water makes for satisfying and aesthetically pleasing kayaking. This is a great river for people wanting to get down in some big canyons without the stress of having to paddle hard class V whitewater to get there.\nBig Silver is accessed from the Fraser Valley east of Vancouver. Go to Harrison Hot Springs and take the Harrison East FSR up the east side of Harrison Lake. The kilometers are well marked the whole way. When you reach Big Silver Creek, the Harrison East FSR will begin to head up the Big Silver valley. The put in is just shy of the 57 km marker where there is an almost roadside 30 foot waterfall. You have to bushwhack up to the road to take out between the 52 and 53 km markers because of a reportedly unrunnable canyon below. Scout your takeout carefully as if you drop much below here the walk out gets much longer. The access and shuttle is a long drive on a dirt road that is rough but not overgrown - much of it is in good shape because of the hydro project just downstream of the take out.\nThere is no online gauge for Big Silver and the level is visual. Unfortunately it is difficult to see much of the notable whitewater from the road, but as you drive up you should be able to get a feel for flow based on eyeballing the river at the spots it's visible, even if they are not part of the Upper. Big Silver does run after rain (sometimes year round, though most years the upper will be snowed in during winter), and a normal snowpack snowmelt season is mid May through late July, or early August in better years. It is not glacier fed and it pretty much dries up when the snow runs out. The\nNahatlatch online gauge\nis probably the best correlation to Big Silver. Preliminary data during snowmelt: 50 cms was a medium low flow, 70 cms was medium/medium-high.\nThe put in waterfall of Big Silver is optional. It is an intimidating waterfall as 1/3 of the flow pours into an enormous sieve that is just a foot or two from the line, but it is otherwise a clean pool-to-pool 30 footer. Upper Big Silver is divided into two separate canyons separated by a distinct section of open class II. The first canyon starts around the corner from the waterfall. The character of the river stays the same through its length with boulder jumble pool drop rapids in the canyon bottom with reasonable scouting opportunities, making just putting on a dealing a viable approach. Half way through the second canyon a tributary (Gold Creek) enters and substantially increases the flow, making the last few rapids some of the best on the river.

Just as you leave town, immediately before crossing the railroad tracks, turn right and drive for about 100m on a gravel road (watch for wash-outs) to a larger area\u00a0 opposite a red gate and park.\u00a0 This is the take-out.\nTo the put-in, return to the main road, turn right (north) and drive for 6km to a bridge over the Birkenhead River.\u00a0 This is one of the put-ons.\nTo add about 1.5km of class III-IV rapids to the run, continue north for about 1km across rail tracks. After 100m there is a left onto a gravel road marked private property for First Nation. About 200meters towards the river there is land under the powerlines which is not First Nation Parcel land, you can park there and walk up the side of the rail for about 50m and put in above the crux or just below it, please don't enter the private property (YEX'WLOA).\u00a0 This is a sensitive spiritual area that must be respected or all access to this area could be lost, take extra care during fishing season.\nThis gravel road is quite over-grown and will pin-stripe your car so you may want to park on the main road and walk in or drive a bit further up the main road until you see the river again and find somewhere to park and enjoy an extra warm-up rapid or you can park just downstream on the main road and put-on below the class IV section.\nThe route in red avoids walking through a sensitive area, put in at either of the blue crosses\nLevel wise the Birkenhead can be run a low as 12cm/s but around 20-25cm/s would be low enough for most, above 35cm/s it is medium flow and above 50cm/s it becomes very continuous with not many eddies and it is harder to rescue boats.\nDescription:\nThis is a lively run with many waves, boulders and holes.\u00a0 At high levels, it is rather continuous and eddies are few and far between. Later in summer and falls, the level drops and the run gets rather bony - but comes up fast again with rain.\nThe main drop at the top near YEX'WLOA is known to the kayakers as the\nHarry Dick\n's rapid, named after a First Nation man who used to live at this spot and was very friendly with the local kayakers.\u00a0 It is a fairly straight forward Class IV drop which you can inspect from river left, it's best to have some speed into it, you can also put on just below it and the next few rapids are fun read and run.\nHarry Dick's Rapid\nBelow here are some excellent small boofs to practice on before the river mellows out for a while before picking up some extra volume from Owl Creek and some steeper gradient with some fun boofs and playwaves.\nClassic Birkenhead fun!\nThe take-out is a little hard to spot so be sure to inspect before paddling.\nUp-stream there is a harder section of classic BC Whitewater\nhttps://www.bcwhitewater.org/reaches/birkenhead-river-upper\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

It's one of the best boulder rapid runs around. As a local top favorite, it says a lot about the quality of the whitewater when you consider all of the great kayaking in the area. People talk about the Upper Birkenhead as being \"BC class IV\", which is a little misleading as to what you'll find on the river - while it can be cruisy at lower levels, this run is a non-stop barrage of long, complex boulder rapids and if you go in there with any sort of decent water level you won't be calling it class IV after you get to the takeout. Everyone comes away raving about how good of a run this river is - you won't be disappointed either.\nFinding the Upper Birkenhead is an easy task with decent dirt road access to both the take out and the put in. From the town of Pemberton head east along highway 99. When you reach Mount Curie follow the road signs towards D'Arcy - do not take the hard right turn to follow the 99. Heading north from Mt. Curie you'll be driving up the Birkenhead valley and eventually you'll cross over the river. Continuing on, the river will be visible as a braided section on the left.\nThe turn on to the Birkenhead FSR is a left turn off the highway where you immediately cross over a rail line. The turn is not well marked - the sign for the Birkenhead Lake Forest Service Road is on the far side of the rail tracks. Head up this road, staying left when you have the choice and you'll quickly pass under a transmission line - the take out is where the power lines cross the river. You can park on the road or follow a rough track down the hill to get closer to the water. To get to the put in, continue up the FSR for about 7 km where a spur (Tenas Creek Branch, it's signed) will break off to the left. Drive down the hill to a bridge over the river - this is the put in.\nThe water level is visual at the put in. The river here is quite wide and almost flat so it can be hard to know the exact level until you get in to the first big rapids (quite a ways downstream). If it looks low here, the river is probably too low. Medium, high and too high are hard to distinguish - for a rough estimate, use the picture below of this rock, which is found immediately downstream of the bridge on river right. Alternatively, if you're really worried you can hike up the river from the take out to the last few rapids - if they're too big for your taste, the rest of the river probably will be too.\nA rock at the put in (downstream river right of the bridge) to use as a crude gauge.  This is medium-high.\nThere's not a lot to say about the Birkenhead once on the water - if you don't have a guide you're probably going to have at least one person out to scout everything. The good news is this river never drops in to a gorge and the whole thing can be easily scouted, and walked with a little effort.\nFrom the outset, the Upper Birkenhead is as it looks from the put in bridge - easy and almost flat. This slowly builds and soon you'll be paddling class II and then class III. This trend will continue right until the end with the rapids generally getting harder the further you descend down the valley. The meat of the run starts at a strong left bend in the river where there is a nice class IV rapid - from there on down it's pretty sustained until the take out.\nEnjoy the excellent boulder rapids that follow - you'll know you're near the end after you run a distinctive S-turn rapid - the long rapid below this one is the final major drop of the run, and it culminates in a log jam that you paddle underneath - scout it on the left. There are a few small boofs between the wood and the take out. And with that, enjoy the photos of the river (they're in downstream order) and get stoked to check it out.\nThere's not much to see from the put in bridge.\nThe start of the goods.\nA good pillow move near the start of the good whitewater.\nbirk6.jpg\n245 KB\nbirk7.jpg\n162 KB\nMatt spots his landing.\nThe last mega rapid - it's a really good one.\nA permanent log jam at the end of the run.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Proximity to town, ease of access, beautiful canyons, stunning water color and exciting whitewater combine to create a classic section of river.\nThe run starts off with a ferry and a portage around a beautiful waterfall before seal launching into a gorgeous class 2 canyon. A brief break in the canyon walls signals the beginning of the whitewater. When the canyon walls go vertical again you are treated to a short, ultra-continuous class 5 canyon. After this there is some fun class 3 boogie before the river mellows out and a short section of \"BC flatwater\" brings you to the takeout where you can head back up for more laps, continue on downstream for some woody braided channels that lead to a lovely set of class 2+ canyons, or call it a day.\nThe biggest problem is the amount of wood that moves around on this river. A full scout of both canyons is required unless you have good quality information from a recent descent. Luckily it is not too difficult to scout either canyon. Scout the 1st by following the canyon rim on river left downstream of Thompson Falls. The critical spot to look at is a pinch that narrows to about 4 feet wide. Below this the 1st canyon opens up and it is possible to scramble up to the canyon rim on either side of the river before committing to the 2nd canyon. The 2nd canyon can be scouted by following the Thompson Falls trail downstream from Thompson Falls for a bit less than a kilometer and then dropping down through the forest to the canyon rim. Alternatively, it is possible to kayak down through the 1st section and then scramble up to scout the 2nd canyon during the run.\nIf you need to hike out between the 2 canyons either side of the river will work, however river right is closer to a road. The river right road is washed out downstream of the 2nd canyon but can be accessed by vehicle via a bridge located a few km upstream of Thompson falls.\nThe meat of the whitewater.

Lots of fun eddies and a good amount of nice catch on the fly surf waves. Although most rapids are not harder than class 3+ the remoteness, potential for wood, and continuous nature of the boulder gardens leading into the waterfall/portage put this run more in the grade 4 range.\nThe run starts out with fun class 3 boulder gardens and one great straight stretch with a few bigger holes. A very obvious horizon line should have you eddying out left to scout or portage the waterfall. Below the waterfall you are treated to more class 3 boulder gardens. The whitewater gradually becomes more bedrock in nature and has a lot of great waves, eddies and holes to play with. The power lines signal the end of the majority of the rapids, however a few class 3 rapids interrupt the flatwater float to the takeout.\nThis run can be done at a large range of water levels with 40 cms being fairly low for most of the run, but perfect for the waterfall. This run could be done at very high water, however, it would get very continuous and push into the trees, especially near the start of the run.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Or, a BC roadside park and huck.\nWhen to Go\nMay-June\nGauge\n0.497cms\u2193 (Oct 21 04:35)\n!\nFirst off, this creek is not located in Boston Bar, but rather on the Coquihalla Pass. Second, it doesn't rate well as a creeking run, but has a decent park and huck drop.\nNow that that's out of the way, when should you go? Early in the snowmelt season (May-June), as the Coquihalla snowpack does not last long. There's no gauge on the creek, but a good target flow could be 15cms on the nearby COQUIHALLA RIVER BELOW NEEDLE CREEK (08MF062), or 100cms on the more commonly referenced COQUIHALLA RIVER ABOVE ALEXANDER CREEK (08MF068). It's a small creek so it needs a pretty healthy flow to be paddleable, but not full freshet due to the amount of wood.\nThe creek is located right next to the Coquihalla Highway as it climbs towards the pass, about 30 minutes northeast of Hope. The trickiest part of shuttling is dealing with the high speeds and controlled access points of a freeway. For the full run, put in at the Box Canyon chain up area, and take out at the Portia U-turn (Exit 202). You might have to drive further along the highway and use U-turn exits to make this happen. It's possible but a bit sketchy to stop across the highway from the best drop, at an unsigned gravel pullout ~10km southbound from the Zopkios Rest Area, just downstream of where the highway crosses back to river right. There may be an old \"Iago\" sign on the northbound lanes which are next to the river, but there is no great pullout on that side.\nThe best part of the run is a bedrock ramp into a 5m falls, ending in a huge pool. The rest of the run is not recommended. It's a mixture of bumpy rapids, logjams, a couple cool tunnels under the highway, and the occasional bedrock ledge. If you want to try any of it, perhaps try the lower half as there is a bit more water and bedrock.\nBelow the Portia take out, the creek is reportedly too steep for kayaking down to the confluence with the Coquihalla. The section of the Coquihalla River from Coquihalla Lakes down to this confluence has been run and is not worth doing (IV+ (P)).\nThe best drop on the run, which is near the Iago sign on the Coquihalla Highway.\nA sample of the full run.\nThere are a few other drops hidden here and there.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The crux rapid would get exciting at high water.\nTime\n3 days\nWhen to Go\nSummer (June-Sept).\nGauge\n600.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:10)\n!\nThe Bowser River is all about getting up close to some huge glaciers. Think of it as a budget Alsek trip, located just off the highway with no flight or permit required. There is not much whitewater, and the price of admission is a 25km paddle out across Bowser Lake. Also, while the mountains and glaciers surrounding the river are some of the most dramatic in BC, the wilderness feel is reduced by ever present mining access roads and powerlines. This trip should be extended by continuing into the classic Bell Irving-Nass (III-IV).\nThe Bowser River flows directly out of several large glaciers and icefields, and at many times of year is likely the largest tributary to the Nass River. The Nass gauge will give an indication of levels, but these readings will be buffered by Bowser Lake. If the Nass is above 800cms, there should be enough water to get through the braids in the upper river. On hot summer days, the upper Bowser probably has a massive diurnal spike. This section should remain runnable at high water, although the crux rapid will be pretty exciting. The water is frigid, pogies are recommended.\nThe Bowser River is located near Meziadan Junction, BC, about 3 hours drive north of Terrace on Highway 37. Pick a takeout at either the Meziadan Bridge on the Nass River, or the Bell 1 Bridge on the Bell-Irving River. For the put in, take Highway 37A west to Stewart, and continue into Hyder, Alaska. There is no US Customs presence, but there is Canada Customs to re-enter Canada. From Hyder, the Granduc Road continues across another unmarked crossing back into Canada, past the Salmon Glacier, and ends near the abandoned Granduc Mine. This is a public road, but there may be active mining operations in the area to avoid. At the Granduc Mine, find a way down the old mine dumps to the lake to put in. To do this route, you will need to clear it in advance with Canada Customs. If this doesn't work out, it's a short heli from Stewart to the put in. The entire river trip is in BC, it's only about 20km of the shuttle that is in Alaska.\nAside from 1 km of steeper class IV+, the whitewater is mostly read and run boulder gardens and braided class II-III between a chain of five glacial lakes. As of 2021, almost every one of these lakes has a glacier either reaching the lake or within walking distance, although these are retreating quickly. This is a very active glacial subalpine environment, so expect unstable ground and changes to the landscape. Paddling out of the first lake, the river may be bony until some tributaries join in. After about 7km on this initial section, the crux rapid comes at a sharp left bend. It is a ~1km section of bumpy class IV-IV+ boulder gardens. At low water it can be scouted and portaged at river level on the left. At high water, portaging up the steep muddy banks would be annoying and possibly hazardous. There is nice camping at the second lake, and the glacier here adds a lot of flow. After an uneventful third lake, at the fourth lake is the site of an enormous landslide, which occurred in 2021 and covered most of the Canoe Glacier. Near the fifth lake is a non-public mining road, and from here down the river eases up to class II. There are a couple decent campsites away from the road just before Bowser Lake. Bowser Lake is 25 km of flatwater and will take most of a day in calm conditions, maybe longer if common mountain winds pick up. Rare landing spots, marginal campsites, and no road access make the Bowser Lake crossing a bit committing. From the lake outlet to the first take out at Bell 1 Bridge on Highway 37 is a short section of class II+ with a couple camping options. But, why take out here when you could continue downstream into the classic Bell Irving-Nass trip (class III-IV, 3-6 days).\nThe view of the Salmon Glacier while driving to the put in on the Granduc Road.\nAn alternate route to the put in without crossing the border.\nFlying in to land at the source of the Bowser River.\nBerendon Glacier.

As of June 2025 our requests have been denied, there is not currently a Lands Manager at Xwisten.\u00a0 We will update this if this situation changes.\u00a0 The upper section above this are not on Indian Reserve Land, so you can still paddle that and take-out at the Horseshoe bend to get some good rapids in, but please be very careful of the pools of water at this location, and follow best practices for 'clean, drain, dry' to ensure no risk of spreading invasive species.\n(http://www.xwisten.ca, 250-256-7423).\nPlease do so a few days before you paddle to give them time to call you back if necessary.\nThis is because there are various places in the river where there is fish study equipment in the river which are potentially hazards, they want us to know about them (they are roughly marked on the map) and remind us they are not liable for paddlers on their river.\u00a0 There are also times when the flow out of the dam will be fluctuated for fish and it's good and polite to chat and make sure there are no issues with the road or fires.\nThe community will be notified you are paddling there and at the take-out there is the Bear Foot Grill, if it's open please patronize them and support the local community.\u00a0 Sadly it wasn't open when we visited.\nIt is worth knowing and understanding some of the history of this valley, the Seton Lake / Downton Lake / Carpenter Lake / Mission Dam complex was constructed before it was necessary to have an environmental impact assessment, a beautiful valley was flooded, communities displaced and the whole landscape was changed forever for the benefit of people who do not live there.\nMost of the water from the Upper Bridge River area is diverted over to Seton lake through a tunnel, and unfortunately the Salmon get confused and are unable to find their way home to the Bridge river.\u00a0 Various steps have been taken to improve this have been done since, the spawning channel on Seton River and the canal which helps mix some Cayoosh river flows out with the dam to disguise the scent of the Bridge.\u00a0 For a long time the Bridge River below Mission/Terzaghi Dam would be completely dry for the first 5km but now appears to have a low base flow at certain times of year.\nThe complex of reservoirs, penstocks and canals for the Seton Powerhouse\nIn the above diagram, most water coming from Downton Reservoir through to Carpenter Reservoir is diverted to Seton lake through 2 large Penstocks eventually being released into the Fraser River 5km downstream of the Bridge River below Lillooet at Seton Powerhouse. \u00a0 The Purple dot is the Bridge River Put-on below the Dam, the Green Dot is the put-on at Yalakom and the red dot is the take out at Bridge River Confluence with the Fraser River.\nThere are various studies worth reading about the fish populations and hydro engineering.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_River_Power_Project\nhttps://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/BCHydro/customer-portal/documents/corporate/environment-sustainability/water-use-planning/lower-mainland/brg-tor-2022-03-29-brgmon-03-rev-2.pdf\nhttps://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/documents/r39265/Bridgeriverflows_1383001211768_bc3aa611f96d44ee3c5c49401073ba9d7f1a333e39094a627c24bd20afbf82a5.pdf\nScenery\n: Excellent, steep canyon walls, hoodoos, jade boulders, dry sagebrush country, stunning assortment of wildlife in a very remote feeling river.\nLength of Run\n: 25 km\nLength of Shuttle (one way)\n: 25 km\nSpecial Considerations\n: This is a very long and remote run. For most of the run it is impossible or very difficult to get out off the canyon. Since the river rarely floods, logs don\u2019t get cleared out. Watch for wood. The entire run is on land of the Bridge River First Nation (Xwisten). Make sure you respect property rights.\nThis is also Grizzly (and Black) Bear country and you almost certainly see a bear on your trip.\nDirections\n: Make your way to Lillooet. Drive north through town and follow the signs to Gold Bridge and Seton Portage for about 6 km until the road crosses the Bridge River. \u00a0 Just before is a pull-out we parked in near the Grill.\nWe took out on river-right at the Grill where there was a rough trail up from the river and nobody around.\nTo the put-in continue on Bridge River Rd. towards Gold Bridge. You can get a glimpse of \u201cCranes Ledges\u201d from a dirt track loop at about 15.5 km (N50 49.239 W122 05.219), and a full scenic view of the Coliseum at 21.5 km. The road drops down to Yalakom River after 25 km. The put-in is on the downstream, left side of the bridge. Make sure you don\u2019t block traffic or private driveways here when you park.\nThe confluence of the Bridge and Yalakom Rivers\nDescription\n:\nThe previous beta for flow was.... \"Since most of Bridge River flows are diverted into Seton Lake, Yalakom River contributes the majority of the water.\"\u00a0 However there has been some changes to the capacity of the dam and discharges for fish habitat restoration and spawning and there is now a little bit of flow.\u00a0 Yalakom Creek contributes the rest of the flow and will have more water, with a combined flow of 18cm/s the river was runnable at what felt like a nice low flow.\u00a0 It has been run as low as 9cm/s but I imagine at 13cm/s would start to get very scrapy in a few places, Yalakom rarely gets high so with a compensatory flow from the Dam the Bridge River should be in for a few weeks a year.\u00a0 If the combined river flow is above 25cm/s\u00a0 some parts start to get a little demanding, lots of the river has boxed in drops so at high flows it could get challenging.\u00a0 There has been scheduled releases of higher flows in the past which makes the entire run 'exciting boogie' rapids with one crux section.\nThe flow of the gauge at the top of this guide is the combined flow of the TRZ dam outflow and Yalakom Creek.\nThis is the flow data coming out of the Dam.\nhttps://www.bchydro.com/info/res_hydromet/data/trz.txt?WT.ac=gmap_hd_trz&WT.mc_id=BCHGglMap\nIf there is flow of at least 10cm/s from the dam it is also possible to start further up at Terzaghi/Mission Dam, there is a guide here.\nhttps://www.bcwhitewater.org/reaches/bridge-river-terzaghi-dam-to-yalakom\nThe normal run starts with a short boulder garden on Yalakom River. Below the confluence with the Bridge more boulder gardens follow, including a nice 2-3 ft ledge. The first drop requiring serious scouting is located at the entrance of the coliseum (although this entrance may not be so obvious from river level and currently has a large piece of wood across it).\nWe usually avoid the mess of boulders and wood by sneaking the drop through a shallow bushy side channel on the right but it is prone to collecting logs.\nLooking upstream at the entrance to Coliseum\nA gravel road on river left leads to the east rim of the coliseum. Another noteworthy drop is encountered where the river leaves the coliseum (N50 51.464 W122 09.371). \u201cJade\u201d consists of several ledges above a house rock. Scout on the right. The most commonly run channel is right of this house rock.\nThe Coliseum Rapid in the Horseshoe Bend\nAt medium and high levels watch out for a sticky hole that forms next to the rock. Beware also of the undercut boulder on the right shore just below the house rock. Soon the rapids become easier. At kilometer 7 a bridge crosses the river at Camoo Creek.\nThe Bridge at Camoo Creek\nThe canyon narrows again and after about 2.5 km and several easier drops you will approach a significant horizon line, the entrance to \u201cCrane\u2019s Ledges\u201d (N50 49.043 W122 05.041). This rapid consists of several ledges and a big \u201cstopper\u201d boulder at the bottom. Scout and if necessary portage on the left.\nBelow \u201cCrane\u2019s\u201d follow a few other attention demanding drops before the river mellows again. After several kilometers things get interesting again when VW bus sized boulders form a maze on the river. The rapids get progressively harder until you reach \u201cHard Hat Drop\u201d shortly after a power line crosses the river. It is best scouted from the left but unfortunately best portaged on the right. The customary line is down the narrow slot on the left. Make sure you check the entire line for wood. One party had to deal with what appeared to be a foot bridge at kayaker\u2019s head-height. After \u201cHard Hat\u201d follow more drops through enormous conglomerate boulders. Enjoy the last kilometer or so through almost vertical-walled canyon before the take-out bridge comes into sight.\nJust after the Horseshoe bend is are some wires across the river which would be problematic at high water.\nThis old bridge towards the middle of the run may be a problem one day.\nA small Archimedes screw operating a fish monitoring station.\nCamping and Food\n: Load up on all you need in Lillooet where you will also find an official campground. There are several spots to camp along Bridge River Rd. Please respect private property, and ask the Lands Manager about where you should be ok to camp.\nNon-paddling Activities\n: Check out the massive Bridge River Rapids on the Fraser. Old beta \"Follow a foot trail on the north side of the take-out bridge upstream on the Fraser.\" It may be now that you can only access this area if you are on a tour with Xwisten, to be confirmed.\nThe museum in Lillooet is worth a visit \u2013 if it is closed, stop and have a look at the gigantic jade blocks in front of it. Check out the \u201cMile Zero\u201d marker. It indicates mile 0 for the numbering of the mile houses along the Cariboo Wagon Road from the olden Gold Rush times. Drive past the put-in through a stunning canyon to the dam that diverts most of the Bridge River water and forms Carpenter Lake. There is also great (and strenuous) cross country mountain biking up the Yalakom Valley (Shulap Traverse, 9-Mile-Ridge and more).\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Like many of the little creeks that flow under highway 99, most of it is too steep and too small to be of much interest for kayaking, but just up from the highway at the top of the town is a nice double drop that makes a worthwhile park and huck diversion when driving up to Squamish, or if you're just looking for something different to do.\nAccess to the river is easy. Get off highway 99 in Brittania Beach (it's the town with the mining museum on the way from Vancouver to Squamish) and follow the main (only) road up the hill through a residential area. The drops are located under the second bridge over the river where the road crosses from river right to river left. Park, scout and paddle - access etc is obvious. The level is visual only. Drive to the drops and have a look - it will be apparent quickly whether the flow is high, low or just right. It runs after rain and during early season snowmelt.\nThe 2 waterfalls are nice drops, and the line is straightforward. The first is about 15 feet and the second is about 20 feet. The lead in is manky and there is a bit of an undercut in the pools between the drops. The major complication here is the fact that there is only 1 eddy about 30 feet downstream from the 2nd waterfall that you absolutely have to catch or you will be flushed over the next unrun/unrunnable 70+ foot waterfall. Luckily it's possible to set very good safety to help stop someone from being washed downstream if they miss or are unable to catch the eddy.\nThough Brittania isn't exactly a classic, it's still good fun. Have fun checking it out.\nThe Brittania Creek double drop.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

There is no lower water limit for the Bulkley Canyon. The two main drops (One Man Crown and Featherbed) become more defined and somewhat more technical below 200m3/s. Up to 450 m3/s the entire run is an exciting big water river with pushy features, large boils, wave trains, whirlpools and eddy lines that are constantly changing and vary with water level. At higher flows the chaos and consequences of swimming increase.\nDescription\nThe first hour or so of the run has beautiful scenery through canyon sections, intermittent rapids up to class III, and plenty of catch on the fly surf waves. About halfway through the run you'll pass through the Gates of the Bulkley (a section where sheer cliffs protrude out into the river on both sides), where the whitewater starts to pick up a bit. 500m downstream the river enters a deeper section of canyon and the first named rapid - One Man Crowd appears behind a subtle right hand bend. A large eddy is typically available on river right where you can regroup / scout the rapid from, but it is guarded by a wide and disruptive eddy line. The rapid is formed by a pinch in the river that creates wild boily pit. Crash through the boils, avoiding the powerful eddylines on the sides, and brace your way to the bottom. Salmon often stack up in the eddy's below this drop during the salmon run. The typical lunch spot is on a large bedrock ledge 500m further downstream where a small creek tumbles into the river on river right.\nThe second half of the run starts with some flatwater past gravel bars. 30 minutes later you'll reach 'S-bend' - recognizable by a right hand bedrock corner followed by a series of holes / waves to dodge before re-entering the canyon. After some fun boogie, a river wide horizon line will appear indicating\u00a0 Featherbed, the second named drop. Scoutable on river right at normal water level, and portagable on river left at low water. Following featherbed is the best section of whitewater that spits you out below the Hagwilget bridge over the Bulkley, which frames an exceptional view of the mountain that towers above Hazelton. Don't let your guard down for the final canyon section (below the bridge), which seems benign but is quite swirly and has whirlpools that have caught many a paddler unaware.\nCatch on the fly surf waves on the first half.\nOne Man Crowd at low flow\nThe eddys below \"One-Man Crowd\" during the pink salmon run.\n\"Featherbed\" at medium-low flow during the salmon run.\nHagwilget Bridge over the Bulkley - near the end of the run.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Please visit the\nSave the Callaghan Facebook page\nfor the latest info, and to log your use of the creek!\nCallaghan Creek is also the site of the annual\nCallaghan Creek Race\n, which has been\nongoing since 2010\n.\nCallaghan Creek is one of the classic rivers that makes Whistler and southwest BC such a fantastic whitewater kayak destination. It's often the first stop for and is a must do for anyone on a tour of the coast. It's the best after work run for Whistler locals, and people close enough to drive there quickly - once you boof the clean waterfalls you'll know why. Arguably the best whitewater kayak river in a zone that is packed full of classic whitewater, the Callaghan is a river not to be missed.\nThe Callaghan is runnable at a broad range of flows (making it appropriate for kayakers with a broad skill range), though it does get too high and too low. A staff gauge is present at the take out, just upstream of the rock outcrop most people climb out on in the Cal-Cheak campsite, that makes understanding flows much easier. Generally speaking it is usually runnable for the whole summer, and it is typically on the low side in August. Hot weather will drive the level up high enough to keep all the but gnarliest paddlers off the river, but it's rain in the fall that produces flows that are truly too high to be safe. A level of 0.1 is low, 0.3 is medium and anything over 0.5 is high. If you're still unsure about flows, check with a local.\nPart of the popularity of the Callaghan is the ease of access. The take out is just downstream of the highway 99 bridge over the creek. Take the Daisy Lake FSR off of the 99 (follow the signs for Whistler Bungee). Immediately on your right is the Cal-Cheak Campsite - park in the big open parking lot. The put in is accessed on the paved river right road. At the ~4 km mark from highway 99, just past Etna Creek, is a small overgrown road and a muddy/grassy parking area. Walk down the road, take the first left down the obvious, cut trail and head downhill to the river.\nThe toughest whitewater on this run is in the first 500 meters. Just below the put in is a big ledge with a bad hole - run it far right - if you can't get far right portaging is recommended. Boulder rapids lead into the waterfalls - you'll find a 12-15 foot falls with the iconic 20 footer shortly after. The rapid in between the falls develops a problematic hole at high water.\nBelow the waterfalls the river changes to continuous boulder rapids with a few big ones in the mix. At a gradual left bend about 3/4 down the river you will want to eddy out above the Old Dirty Bastard, the biggest non-waterfall rapid. There is often a large log jam on river right above this rapid where you scout. After more boulders and a bit more bedrock you'll all too soon pass under the highway and get to the take out. Hope you have some gas left in the tank because you'll definitely want to run this one again.\nFlying off the first waterfall.\nThe main event.\nA fantastic place to go kayaking.\nODB.  A burly rapid, but good to go.\nCallaghan Creek Trivia\nThe original put in was located on river left prior to 2012. A spur road approximately 3.5 km up the river left road was decommissioned, closing access to that side.\nThe river right access trail was cut by Philip Middleton in 2013.\nThe take out gauge was installed in early 2013 by then-local Greg Dashper.\nThe gauge was replaced in 2019 by Phil Middleton after it was damaged by flooding. The new gauge was paid for by donations from Callaghan Creek Racers in 2018.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Short snowmelt season in the spring.\nThe Cameron River is an amazing class IV run located between Parksville and Port Alberni on Vancouver Island, near the spectacular Cathedral Grove. From a tranquil start this river slowly picks up steam to run through several distinct canyons containing a lot of bedrock before you get to the cut trail back up to the road. There are great boofs, sweet lines, good scenery and a few short and tight bedrock mini-gorges that are top notch. Everything on the Cameron at normal flows is in the class IV range, but we wouldn't recommend this river to a crew that are maxed out on class IV - in the heart of the run the action is fairly stacked.\nThe Cameron runs after rainfall, and it has a short snowmelt season in the spring time. The\nEnglishman River gauge\nor the\nLittle Qualicum River gauge\ncan be used to get an idea of what flows are doing in the area. The Cameron fills the lake that feeds the Little Qualicum, but the lake buffers out the rapid rises and falls the Cameron sees after rain. To make matters easy, a visual gauge was installed by Shayne Vollmers on the river where it is near the highway to save driving in the logging roads to check the level. The Cameron is the river that runs through Cathedral Grove - on the west side of the Grove the river runs adjacent to the main road. The gauge is located across the river from an obvious dirt pull off. 4.5 on this gauge is low but still good fun. 6.0 is medium. 7.0 and over is high water and the river gets accordingly more difficult.\nThe shuttle access is clearly seen on\nthis map\n. Heading west on route 4 out of Cathedral Grove brings you up a big hill. Passing a brake check area and the Port Alberni summit are the first reference points. After passing these and just as you start to descend down to Port Alberni there will be a dirt logging road on your left heading south that is marked with an \"Arrowsmith\" sign. Follow this road down along massive clear cuts. It will join the Cameron Main and you will want to keep left. This brings you up the river valley and eventually to a bridge over the Cameron, which is the put in. The take out is approximately 4.5 km back down the road, right where the road leaves the river valley. This clear cut has a trail cut down to the river on the upstream end - a semi-obvious path leaves the parking and goes to the water. If you haven't done the run before we\nhighly\nrecommend walking to the river so you'll be able to recognize the take out from the water.\nThe Cameron starts off flat, which doesn't last for long. Things quickly pick up through some warm-up whitewater and before long you'll get to the first canyon section of the run. The character of the run stays constant through its whole length with many bedrock rapids interspersed with some bouldery stuff. The best part of the whole river are the short but defined mini gorges that are found throughout - they are awesome. Most of the run can be easily boat scouted - that which you can't see down is easy to scout from shore - keep a look out for wood.\nGenerally speaking, the second half of the run is a little harder. This is where you'll find the most concentrated action. The last rapid is a bedrock mini gorge that exits the canyon as the valley walls fall away. After you pass this rapid the take out is found immediately on the left. Enjoy the steep walk up the hill, and go load up to do it again on this Island class IV classic.\nScouting the first scout-worthy rapid on the Cameron.\nRunout of the S-Turn micro canyon.\ncameron3.jpg\n346 KB\nTypical Cameron style.\nIn the heart of the run things close in a little bit.\nPermanent log limbo drop.\nLike most Island rivers, this one gets very, very high.

It's unlikely you'll need to portage anything unless the river is flooding.\nTime\n15 minutes - 2 hours\nWhen to Go\nAfter heavy rain.  Runs at low water during snowmelt.\nGauge\n15.719cms\u2193 (Dec 31 14:00)\nThe Capilano is another member of the North Vancouver trifecta of whitewater rivers along with the\nSeymour\nand the\nLynn\n. Although the Capilano is the easiest run on the North Shore, it too flows through a beautiful, lush rainforest canyon with easy access and a quick shuttle. The Capilano is of interest to intermediate boaters at low water when it offers a pleasant paddle through mellow canyons and over gravel bars. At very high flows the run turns into a fun blast down big water class III with roiling boils, fun eddies and squirrely seams. Medium levels bring something in between. It's worth noting that grading the Capilano over 200 cms is difficult as even though the rapids don't get much harder the danger factor continues to increase with water level.\nThe Cap has a convenient stick gauge at the put in. We recommend 3 as a minimum level, though lower is possible. Many intermediate boaters start to shy away at 5-6 due to the boily nature of the narrow canyons and headwalls near the start. The run starts to get a big water feel once the level goes off the gauge (~8). Metro Vancouver water resources recently made available an\nonline gauge for the Cap\n, measured in cms. 30-40 cms is ~3 on the stick, 150 is ~8 on the stick and 200 cms is at the top of the concrete weir the gauge is bolted to (est. 10). The upper limit on the Cap is hard to find. It's of interest to class V boaters at as high as possible when the Seymour and Lynn are blown out; despite the low gradient it is a very fun paddle, especially if you catch all the boiling eddies. At extreme, biblical flood levels (300+ cms) a dangerous compression hole with an unbeliveably large recirculation (the 'death hole') forms in the first 500 m of the run - the Cap rarely gets high enough for this to happen, but it's worth being aware of if you are paddling the run during an extreme high water event. Please scout well - the Cap is no joke at 300+ cms.\nAccess to the Capilano is along paved city streets. The put in is at the Capilano Fish Hatchery north of highway 1 off of Capilano Road. This area is a park with ample parking and many trails along the river. Hop the fence and put in below the weir at the hatchery itself. There are multiple take out options for the Capilano, depending on how far you want to paddle downstream, and how much road congestion you want to drive through. We recommend parking behind the Evergreen Squash Club located off Curling Road. Curling Road is north of Marine Drive - turn in at the Shell station. The parking lot is around the back - drive slowly. Make sure to walk to the river to check were you will need to stop paddling. If this parking doesn't work for you, just pick any other location with public access to the water with parking nearby.\nThere is not much to say about the kayaking itself. The run starts off with rapids that run through some small canyons, with headwalls and boils being the main challenge. About half way down the walls fall back and the majority of the rapids are formed by gravel bars. The death hole is at a left bend with a narrow constriction. It's possible to eddy out above to walk it. Any other objective hazards should be easy to see from well upstream.\nView\nCapilano\nin a larger map\nLooking up towards the put in of the Capilano.\nPaddling in to House Rock rapid.

The lower section of the river is gravel and almost dry looking where you drive over it on the road, but looks can be deceiving as the upper reaches of this run form a bedrock canyon with some superbly clean slides and waterfalls sandwiched between sections of terrible mank. Below the canyon is a short, manky boulder slalom leading to a series of enormous waterfalls (100 footer and a 60 foot double drop) situated in a picturesque local park - it's strange that this run is not well known.\nTake the (V+) rating in the Vitals above with a grain of salt - this only applies to the big waterfalls - for most kayakers this river will be a very manageable class IV-V river - boating the big ones is a mission in itself. They have both been run.\nHitting a good flow on the Cascade is difficult. Like all runs in the area, it will get too high during periods of heavy rain. That being said, the river drains a small low elevation zone so it doesn't have a big snowmelt season and it flashes quickly after rain. We recommend going after moderate rain, or after the first blast of warm weather early in the spring. If the rapids directly above the waterfalls look manky but passable, the rest of the river should be ok.\nThis river is easy to find. Go to Mission and then head east out of town on highway 7, north of the Fraser River. Check out the map above for directions, and as you leave town you'll see signs leading the way to Cascade Falls Park. Take a left turn at Sylvester Road and drive for approximately 11 km to Cascade Falls Park at the bottom of the river.\nUnfortunately this one is a hike in trip. While there is a road that heads up the valley, it is gated and it's unclear when or if it is ever opened. From the parking lot it's a quick walk up to check out the huge set of waterfalls at the end of the run - you can't miss them. You may want to hike up above the two drops to make sure you know where to stop boating (there are excellent trails all over the place here), although it's hard to miss the big horizon line from above. This will also give you a chance to check out the flow in the river.\nThe hike to the put in is all uphill. If you go far enough, the river will come right up to the road without any downhill hiking at all. Following the road from the parking lot will bring you under and along some power lines. If the road forks, stay right - the trail will start to drop away from the power cut and the river will get closer and closer. This trail ends where an old cable car crosses the water; the upper put in. Alternatively (recommended) you can hike in to where the river gets good by cutting down to the river where there is a big steel retaining wall under the power lines - this is the option that eliminates most of the terrible mank at the start.\nFrom the upper put in there are very low volume, terribly manky boulder rapids. A tributary entering from the left doubles the flow and marks the start of the canyon (this is where the lower put in drops you to the river). After the canyon starts the action comes quick with a bunch of boulder rapids that slowly morph into bedrock. The first major scout is obvious - what you'll find is an amazing slide to boof/sliding waterfall double drop - there is a cave at the bottom of the second drop.\nSome smaller, tricky to scout rapids in the canyon will then take you around a left-hand bend in the river to a great set of three slides. Below the third slide are one or two more ledges, after which the canyon ends with a very clean waterfall. Charge the mank after the canyon down to the obvious horizon line above the huge waterfalls at the end of the river. Some of the rapids in here have fun lines. Fire up the big ones if you like - they are stout! Have fun getting in there and checking out the Cascade.\nTaking a break on the hike in.\nThe first rapid of the day after the cable car put in.\nThis is what most of the upper river is like.  Use the lower put in.\nOne of the only good rapids above the canyon.\nThe first decent boof of the run - Matt Kompass dropping in.\nOne of the entry boulder rapids in the canyon.\nKyle Dunn probes the first half of the double drop.\nAll smiles in the run out of the double drop.\nGetting ready for the big slide.\nBig slide.\nThe second slide.\nAre you gonna eat that?\nThe burly third slide, probably the crux of the run.\nExit falls.\nThe 100+ foot waterfall.\nThe lip of the big one.\nThe double drop immediately below the big one.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

      "full_text": "BCWhitewater\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nAbout\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact\nBecome a member\nCayoosh Creek\nWhat It's Like\nNice river running through a deep, arid canyon.  Classic scenery and good whitewater.\nClass\nIV+ at medium levels.\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to difficult.\nTime\n2-4 hours.\nWhen to Go\nLater half of the SW BC season - July-August.  Spring is possible.\nCayoosh Creek is a nice river tucked away on the far side of the Coast Mountains of SW BC. Similar to the\nHurley River\nin character but slightly easier, the Cayoosh is also full of mind bending scenery and good (but not classic) whitewater. Starting high up in the mountains above Pemberton, the Cayoosh runs along nearly the whole length of the Duffey Lake Road down to the town of Lillooet where it joins the Fraser River. The classic section of this river, described here, is worth checking out especially if you're in the area or if you have a little extra time to drive.\nThe Cayoosh is a great resource in that it is at good flows when the runs in Whister start to drop out for the season. Look to the Cayoosh later in July and August. Unfortunately there is no online gauge and the flow is read visually only. There is a photo below of a distinct rock below the put in bridge that shows a nice medium level. This river is unreasonable to attempt at the height of the snowmelt season. You can also paddle this river in the spring (May) before the rivers really roar to life.\nAccess to the Cayoosh is easy, from the well-travelled Duffey Lake Road that runs between Pemberton and Lillooet. The put in is close to 1.5 hours from Pemberton, and about 15 minutes from Lillooet. The put in is at the last major bridge above Lillooet where the road switches from river right to river left (coming from Pemberton). The road climbs far away from the river if you continue on towards Lillooet. Be sure to put in at the correct bridge - there is a much gnarlier section on the Cayoosh directly above the classic put in. The take out is reached by following the main road downstream. Approximately 6.5 km down, you will find a dirt road on the right. Once on the dirt, take a right (the left is gated) and drive until you reach a bridge over the river.\nFrom the put in bridge, the Cayoosh starts off mellow. Things build slowly as the river runs through a forested valley. As the forest changes to crumbling dirt and rock walls, the whitewater picks up - scout where appropriate. The rapids on the Cayoosh are fun but they can be rocky, even when there is a lot of water. The biggest rapid of the river comes in the first few km, and is signified by a large horizon line and a steep crumbling bank on river right, where you get out to scout. Scouting is easy - the main (top) part of the rapid is often portaged to an eddy immediately below the big drop. Portaging further is sketchy but possible. Good rapids continue below. When the river opens up to wide bouldery rapids it's not over. Just before things wind up for good, you'll encounter a mini-canyon with some class III-IV rapids at the start. It's all good to go, but it would be difficult to portage anything in there. The mini-canyon ends will a flush box style rapid that is intimidating to look at, but is fun the paddle. Below here there is another couple hundred meters of rapids and you'll quickly reach the take out bridge. Enjoy this run! Keep in mind that road is far, far away from the water for most of the run and walking out should only be considered in the case of an emergency.\nCayoosh Creek put in sign.\nA rock just below the put in bridge that can possibly be used as a gauge - this is medium.\nStarting off right - one of the first rapids.\nThe first rapid you can't easily see down.

Turn left on Squamish Valley Rd. (Alice Lake Provincial Park is on the right). After about 3.5 km you will get to a bridge across Cheakamus River. Here is a possible take-out on river left at the Sunwolf Outdoor Centre (N49 47.968 W123 09.361). Zero your odometer here. Immediately after the bridge turn right on Paradise Valley Rd and continue to a second bridge after 3.2 km (second take-out option just upstream of this bridge, N49 49.724 W123 09.115). Drive across the bridge and keep going across Culliton Creek at 8.6 km. The road ends at 10.7 km \u2013 this is the uppermost put-in (N49 53.430 W123 10.801). The last kilometer or so is rather rough. Another lower put-in is at 6 km (N49 52.344 W123 10.476). This avoids the class III drop at Culliton Creek.\nDescription\n: This is a great run for novices, but keep an eye out for the frequent logs. There is only one class III drop at Culliton Creek, where the creek releases its load of rocks and rubble. Elsewhere expect small boulders, the occasional hole and some nice (but small) surf waves.\nYou can make the run longer by continuing through the Squamish River confluence and taking out at the Watershed Grill in Brackendale. The section from the bridge at Sunwolf/Fergie's to the Squamish River confluence is more continuous and has a handful of class III rapids. It's also a worthwhile section on its own.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Some wood.\nClass\nIV-IV+\nScouting / Portaging\nScouting is ok.  Difficult to portage in spots, if you're forced to.  Falls is easy to walk.\nTime\n2-3 hours for a relaxed first trip.\nWhen to Go\nAll season, very pushy at high flows.  Reasonable minimum is 2.1.\nGauge\n1.875m\u2193 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nGauge info: if you have previous experience on the Cheak, note that the gauge changed sometime before the 2015 season and now reads about 0.1 m lower than it used to. Levels are adjusted appropriately on this page.\nThe Cheakamus River is synonymous with Whistler kayaking, largely because of the ultra-classic\nUpper Cheak\nsection near Function Junction. Unbeknownst to many and maybe avoided by others because of tales of epic log jams and the Whistler waste water treatment plant, there is an equally fun and perhaps more adventurous stretch that departs from the Upper Cheak take out and ends at the confluence with Callaghan Creek. It's a little bit harder, a little bit more committing, it has a great waterfall for those so inclined and there is a lot more wood in the river. You can run it as a stand-alone section of whitewater if you want something short, but it's best combined with the Upper Cheak to make a great hour or two of river running.\nThe Cheak has an\nonline gauge\n. The gauging station is at the junction between the Upper and Balls sections and it is accurate. Alternatively, you can physically look at the gauge. Low water is 2.1 m, and the upper limit is whatever you're comfortable with. Prior to 2013 this section was not runnable at high water because of a log jam that couldn't be paddled under, but it washed away, opening the run to all water levels.\nAccess is straightforward. The put in is the same as the take out for the\nUpper Cheak\n(it's best to combine it with the upper). West of Whistler, turn south at the Function Junction exit off highway 99. Follow the river left logging road (Cheakamus Lake Road). After you cross the river to the left take a left turn in to a large parking area/trailhead and the gauge site (down the trail). The take out is west down highway 99 from Function - just before you cross over Callaghan Creek, the Daisy Lake FSR turns off to the left. Follow the signs for Whistler Bungee. You can take out at the bridge over the Cheak, or at the Cal-Cheak North camp site.\nOn the water there is not much to speak of at the start. Splashy water floats you past the Whistler waste water treatment plant (think sewage) - although the water quality does drop when you get past here it is still much better than many places that people have been known to go kayaking.\nMore easy river leads into the first rapid - Balls To The Wall. It's a sweet, easy waterfall with a tricky run out through a boily mini canyon that has a very dangerous pocket on the right wall at higher flow. After this great warm up, a few bends in the river brings you to the first major log jams - right now there are big log piles on either side of the river - the first rapid, squeezed between the wood, is runnable but is pretty high consequence as the next rapid is fully (and maybe permanently) clogged with wood. Portaging is easiest on the right, and it has a tricky put in.\nShortly below the portage is boogie that leads past the site of the old log jam. After a strong boof over a fairly big hole, the walls fall away and the river eases to class II for a short distance. When the walls close up again get ready for the big finale rapid, and a tedious paddle out through a braided section that collects wood.\nA sweet boof off Balls to the Wall.\nHeading for the run out of Balls.\nThe first of the epic log jams.\nA very bad log jam.\nGood rapids below the portage.\nSome random boogie.\nThe limbo log jam, the high water limiting factor that is no longer there.\nThe start of the last awesome rapid.\nThe whole last rapid.

It's not super obvious so go check it out before getting on if it's your first time.\u00a0 The put-on is the take-out for the main Callaghan at the Cal-Cheak Rec Site, please park on your left near the trash bins as the campground host likes to keep the side nearer the river clear for RVs.\u00a0 He's been there a few years and doesn't seem to mind people skirting his site to walk to the river to check the gauge, but please put on a bit further downstream.\nThe Cal-Cheak is a fun section with some nice surf waves at higher flows.\u00a0 You're starting on the Callaghan below the famous main section, either above the bridge for more waves or just below, then shortly after the campground the Cheakamus joins from the left. \u00a0 It is possible to also start from the Cal-Cheak North Rec Site in which case you start on the Cheakamus River at the take-out for the Balls Section, this is less paddled and sometimes has wood.\nThere is also a small gravel yard on the North side of Highway 99 which has a put-on further up the Callaghan and there are sometimes a couple of waves there worth a play.\nThere's only 3 real rapids of note.\u00a0 The weir drop near the start, Testicle Rock and the ledge wave/hole, the rest of the river is read and run boulder garden.\nFull river-run video here from Troy (T-Bone) Gibbs\nThis is a fun river for intermediate paddlers, lots of good eddies and waves to surf!\u00a0 The river goes at almost all river levels, but becomes more consequential at high water due to the limited time to rescue from the last rapid to the takeout and wood is a persistent issue.\u00a0 The River has the Cheakamus Flow and Callaghan Flows so depending on rain or melt one can be much higher than the other!\nThe weir drop is long and runs diagonally across the river from left to right, stick to the outside of the bend at first then aim for somewhere near the middle-right where a small shelf sticks out.\u00a0 There are various options, and it normally feels a little shallow heading into it.\u00a0 River right always goes too.\nWeir Drop\nTesticle Rock (Also known as C*ck and Balls)\u00a0 is two large boulders that seems to eternally have a large piece of old growth wood shafter down the middle.\u00a0 Wood often collects around here too creating nasty sivs.\u00a0 Sticking left you can normally stop in an eddy and boat-scout the best way down the left below the rocks.\nTroy and Martin sneaking left at Testicle Rock\nLooking back upstream at Testicle Rock (pic from Troy Gibbs)\nA few more waves and one more significant rapid and you're very quickly at the end of this river.\u00a0 Again the take out is not obvious, I've overshot it before and had to paddle to the eddy on the beach instead.\nMartin making the non-descript take-out eddy, go check it first!\nThe take out (looking upstream), River LEFT, spot the yellow flagging tape visible.\nDownstream is\nDaisy Lake Canyon\n, in an emergency the first part of this section is mostly read and run class IV+ and it is possible to get back up, but it would be a lot of effort.

Peak snowmelt not recommended.\nGauge\n1.875m\u2193 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nHave you ever wondered if there is anything beyond the\nUpper Cheak\nparking lot? Didn't think so. But if you have a free afternoon, it's worth checking out the easy trail to beautiful Cheakamus Lake. If you bring your kayak, you can paddle some OK wood-filled whitewater back down to the classic Upper Cheak.\nIt's best to combine this run with the Upper Cheakamus and take out at House Rock parking near Function Junction (see Upper Cheakamus for directions). Alternatively, it is possible to take out just before the Upper Cheak, but the river flows swiftly towards the waterfall at a must make eddy.\nTo get to the put in, go back to the Cheakamus Lake FSR and follow it up river right (east side) for ~8km to a parking lot at the end of the road, the trailhead for Cheakamus Lake. The hike to the lake is a pretty cruisy 3km on a well graded trail through shaded old growth forest. After an initial uphill, it's actually mostly downhill too. About halfway through the hike, the Helm Creek Trail on the right leads to an alternate put in at a footbridge. But it's worth continuing to the lake for the views.\nThe flow range for this section will be similar to the Upper Cheak (minimum 2.1, medium 2.5, and high up to 3.0). However, medium to high flows are not recommended due to the amount of wood. A level of 2.35 was a little bumpy but not brutal, with just enough time to stop in marginal eddies above wood. While the difficulty of the whitewater is III+, the river is more suited for class IV boaters due to the amount of wood and tricky take out.\nFrom the lake, the river starts glassy and calm. The crystal clear water here is really one of the best parts of the run. Very soon the river splits around an island, and both channels can be blocked with wood. A portage across the island is flat and through open forest until the river is clear again. Scenic class II leads to the Helm Creek Trail footbridge. Just below here Helm Creek confluences from the left, and it brings a huge amount of volcanic debris from the Black Tusk massif, which changes the character of the riverbed to continuous class III+ braids. Unfortunately, wood lurks on every island and bend, and often you will be scanning logjams to see if the channel is clear. Eventually the river does channelize somewhat, and after you see a road and powerline along river left, some of the best rapids quickly lead to the put in for the Upper Cheakamus and the waterfall (class V). Here it is key to catch an eddy on river left behind two large boulders, at the spot where people normally put in if they are going to run the \"lead in\" of the Upper Cheak falls. Or if you're up for it, run the falls (V) and carry on down the Upper Cheak (IV).\nCheakamus Lake in Garibaldi Provincial Park.\nPutting on at the lake outlet.\nPortaging down the left channel sucks, try the right channel or the island.\nHelm Creek Trail footbridge.

Levels are adjusted appropriately on this page.\nThe Daisy Lake Canyon is the underused section of the Cheakamus between the Callaghan Creek confluence and Daisy Lake. It has a reputation for tough whitewater in a significant canyon - this is definitely true but for boaters up for the challenge it delivers some standout class V whitewater early or late in the season when many other runs are low. The quality is on par with all the other great whitewater in the Whistler zone so don't let tales of woe scare you off from giving it a go as it's completely reasonable to figure it all out on your own.\nFlows in the Daisy Lake Canyon are a combination of water from both the upper Cheakamus and Callaghan Creek - the Cheak has a convenient gauge but the flow added by the Callaghan always adds an element of uncertainty to the water level so use that gauge cautiously. The easiest season to gauge the level is in the late summer and fall when the Callaghan has dropped to very low levels. Look for 2.3 on the Cheak gauge for a nice medium level when the Callaghan is low. It's probably fine as low as 2.0. Gauging the level in the spring when the Cheak remains low is difficult as the Callaghan often roars to life before the Cheak starts to rise and groups have put on with the Cheak at around 2 to find the Daisy Lake Canyon at the upper limit of runnable. There are no convenient visual gauges to check the level in the canyon.\nThe put in is at the Callaghan/Cheakamus confluence, where you quickly run the Cal-Cheak down to the head of the canyon. Turning off highway 99 at the Daisy Lake FSR (follow the signs for Whistler Bungee) you can put in at a number of places including the Cal-Cheak campsite or the bridge over the Cheakamus about 1 km from the highway. Alternatively you can start at the Cal-Cheak take out if you know where it is.\nThe take out is randomly along highway 99 just south of the Brandywine Falls Provincial Park. The trail from Daisy Lake comes up to the road where the big transmission line crosses the road at the north end of the lake. There is no parking in the immediate vicinity of the trail - about 500 m to the north is a large pull out where you can easily park.\nFrom the confluence down to the canyon is of little consequence. This is a popular intermediate stretch of whitewater and the canyon collects and destroys boats that get lost when people swim. The canyon entrance is obvious and the first rapids are good class IV warm up. The bungee bridge passes over head and the canyon walls get bigger, as do the rapids. After a large river-wide ledge you scout from high on the right comes a huge V+ rapid that is almost always portaged. It has a busy class III lead in to a small one boat eddy on river left - needless to say tread carefully here. The portage takes about 30 minutes down the left shore. Most people complete this canyon with 2 portages.\nMore big rapids come below here with ledges and continuous sections. As things start to ease off you will all too soon reach the lake - if the lake is low you'll get a few extra rapids. Paddle directly across the lake to the inlet of Brandywine Creek where a short but very steep trail goes up to the highway. Scout it out beforehand as it's hard to find from the water. Enjoy the Daisy Lake Canyon - it's good stuff.\nThe rapid under the bungee bridge.\nMore action near the start.\nA typical scene in the heart of the canyon.\nOne of the best rapids on the run.\nA nice rapid immediately after the big portage.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

All year depending on your low water tolerance.\nGauge\n23.3cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nThe often overlooked \"Dam Run\" on the Cheakamus starts immediately below Daisy Lake Dam and ends next to the highway before the river enters the seldom-run Cheakamus Canyon. This is a fun class III run with a manky class V called Alpine Drop near the only bridge over the run.\nTo get to the put-in, drive north on Highway 99 towards Whistler. Shortly after the Rubble Creek Trailhead turnoff and immediately before the bridge over the Cheak, park in a small pull-out. Walk through the woods towards the river here. You can either put-in immediately or walk up the bank towards the dam to run the put-in rapid (class IV at most flows).\nThe river is mostly fun class III wave trains, a few a little steeper and longer than the rest. Around Rubble Creek, the riverbed is peppered with vertical tree stumps -- exercise caution around these with newer paddlers. They're easy to avoid, but could be very dangerous. Fun fact: a debris flow dammed the Cheakamus causing it to flood an existing forest. When the river cut through, it formed a new channel through said forest, leaving those stumps in the riverbed.\nShortly after one of the steeper rapids you'll find Alpine Drop. The horizon line is obvious, as is the bridge visible downstream. Some paddlers do a long portage on river right, but it's much easier to eddy-hop down the left bank and portage at river level. Be careful not to miss the eddies, but at least up to 100cms, this route is quite straightforward.\nGreg Lee on Alpine Drop at low water.\nAfter Alpine Drop, there's still a good bit of whitewater left. As you approach an obvious pull-out along the highway, the takeout is close. Paddle past the pull-out but eddy out immediately left at the bottom of this wavetrain. There's a nice beach and trail up to the pull-out from there. You can go a few rapids further (they are some of the best rapids) but it's a pain to get back up to the road from there.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Levels are adjusted appropriately on this page.\u00a0 This guide has last been updated in December 2025.\nIf there ever was a flagship run for the boating around Whistler, the Upper Cheakamus just might be it. Although relatively short it is packed with great rapids from start to finish and it has a season that extends from the start of the melt well into the fall. To top it off there's a small waterfall at the put in that is one of the best boofs in town. No matter if you're a seasoned veteran or someone looking for that next step into continuous and pushy whitewater, you are definitely going to have a good time.\u00a0 The Cheak is used during the Callaghan Race Weekend as a seeding time-trial and it's home to the absolute chaos of the Pinball weekend at the end of the summer.\nLow Water Triple 1 and 2 during Kayak Pinball - Photo Dave Wortley\nThe Upper Cheak is incredibly popular staple run for locals and out-of-towners alike. The take out is at the Function Junction intersection west of Whistler. Turn south, towards Cheakamus Crossing (the athletes village that was built for the 2010 Olympics, now private homes), turn right onto the Logging road then turn almost immediately right up the logging road up the west side of the river. After crossing the bridge there will be a left turn after 100 meters leading to a large parking lot. A trail goes down to the water where you'll find a staff gauge that corresponds to the online gauge (As of 2024 the gauge has been lost and not replaced).\n\"House Rock\" carpark is a designated Rec Site and known as a paddling staging area. It's been used as a base for paddlers for 30 years and it's the place to go and meet people to paddle with and hear stories of carnage on the river, hence it's nickname \"The carpark of broken dreams\". We are incredibly lucky to have this location with the expansion of Whistler into this area and we must look after it.\u00a0 Please clean up any trash, fires are no permitted and overnight camping is prohibited.\u00a0 It's a little bit of paddling paradise, please keep it great!\nThe put in is further up the west side logging road., but due to new housing the route changed significantly in 2022.\u00a0 Exit the carpark right drive back across the bridge, turn left onto the west side FSR, turn left at the road intersection, continue for about 200m to a 3-way stop and turn left up Mt Fee Road. Drive up this road for a few minutes (please keep to the speed limit in this heavy residential area) once you get to the roundabout either stop here for access to the \"Half Cheak\" or turn up a steep hill that can be rough, the road will flatten out. Keep going passed the Loggers Lake pull-out parking for another couple of minutes, shortly you will come to a 3 or 4 car pullout on the left, and you will see the river (shoaly class II-III) through the trees. This is the put in. If you want to run the put in falls go straight to the water here. If you want to start below the falls there is an obvious trail 50 meters back down the road that takes you to the eddy, or the big seal launch, below the falls.\nThe Cheakamus is runnable at a wide range of flows. A fair minimum is 2.1, where the river is rocky and not pushy. The Cheak starts getting prime at 2.5. At this flow the river is solid class IV the whole way with one rapid that's perhaps a little more challenging. Reasonable upper levels depend on the boater, but it's not unusual to be running it over 3.0 on the gauge (it's class V at high water). As always, difficulty changes accordingly with the level and because of the continuousness you need to act quickly to save gear should someone swim, even at lower flows. There is a good trail along the river left bank the whole way down.\nThe put in falls is optional. It's a great boof but it does develop a decent hole as the level goes up. Most people who run it regularly start to think twice once the level gets up around 2.9. At lower flows around 2.35 and below some paddlers choose to run the river right side of the falls instead.\u00a0 A word of caution here that the geology here is fresh, the waterfall only formed in 2003 after a major flood, so the bedrock is still shifting and this waterfall occasionally changes so do inspect.\nPierce Huser running left line of Put-in Falls.- Photo Dave Wortley\nBelow the falls things start right away - the first rapid of note is called Cobra, a rapid which has a variety of lines on it and it's a great test of the paddler, avoid the gutter on the right.\nAfter this things ease slightly, there's a great ledge drop and then things start to pick up when you see a suspension bridge in the distance.\u00a0 The lead into Suspension Bridge has an awesome super-boof, there are multiple lines down Suspension Bridge rapid, and the crux tends to be the last feature directly below the bridge.\u00a0 At high flows paddlers sneak around the hole by staying hard left and boofing off the ledge, at other flows it's a tricky left to right move to avoid staying out of what can be a rather recirculating hole at 2.5m+.\nThe hole below the bridge during Pinball - Photo Nick Gottlieb\nImmediately after Suspension Bridge is Triple Drop, the toughest of the run. It has a long entrance with a big hole at the bottom. Confusingly it is more of a double-drop with the third being after the main event and only challenging when logjams are present on the river right of triple 3.\u00a0 Triple 1 at low water is steeper and is just as challenging as Triple 2.\u00a0 The large boulder on the right side of Triple 2 has moved slightly in recent years and has made the hole slightly stickier.\u00a0 On the river left side of Triple 2 is 'the flake' when this is in you can use it to launch your boat clear of the hole and avoid having to do a late boof through the pile, but beware you don't end up in a room of doom eddy on river left which can be a challenge to get out of!\nClearing the hole of Triple 2 by using the Flake on River left\nThe river goes on with more high quality read and run rapids below triple, great boof and eddy practice spots.\u00a0 The 'Half-Cheak' put-on is just above Bowling Alley on river left, a surprisingly technical rapid with one tombstone rock to avoid.\u00a0 Starting the river here allows paddlers to experience the continuous nature of the Cheak but avoids the challenge of Suspension Bridge and Triple Drop.\u00a0 Frequently paddlers doing the full run will pick up some doing the half-cheak run here. It makes an already short run shorter but there is still plenty of good spots to practice on.\nThe next time the river steepens up is at U-Boat a fun rapid with some technical eddies to catch or just one hole to either avoid or plug deep and enjoy the clean water of the Cheakamus.\nThe last rapid is called House Rock and it is marked by a big square boulder in the middle of the river. Don't underestimate the lead-in rapid, it's well worth scouting this before you leave the take-out before paddling this section as it's not easy to boat-scout or scout from the banks there.\u00a0 The left channel of House Rock whilst easier tends to get clogged with wood more frequently.\nThe take out is next to the old stick gauge on river left. And that's it - jump out for a second lap or if the level is right keep on going through\nBalls to the Wall\n- it's just as good, and a little bit harder.\u00a0 You can also take-out just at the bridge for a little more eddy practice, it's a short walk back to the carpark.\nUpper Cheakamus History\nThe put in falls didn't exist until the fall of 2003. A large flood dug a new channel, which dried up a class III rapid and replaced it with the falls.\nA young paddler, Peter Thompson, died while running the put in falls at low water (old 2.3) in 2012. He became trapped on a piece of wood lodged at the bottom of the falls deep in the river left slot. More debris lodged in this slot should always be a consideration at low flow.\n2020 the road to the original put-on was closed, a new put-on was established on river left upstream of the falls but had a steep descent to use. In 2023 access returned to the original put-in parking.\nHouse Rock Carpark on a busy weekend!\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

While the Chilliwack may be better for skills progression and easy laps, the Chehalis offers a scenic wilderness canyon experience runnable at a wide range of flows and seasons, outside of the dry summer months. Uncertainty about flows used to make the drive out here a gamble, but with the gauge now online hopefully the river gets enjoyed more than ever before.\nThe Chehalis River is a free flowing, low to moderate elevation watershed that is buffered by the respectably sized Chehalis Lake. There is a modest snowmelt season from April to June, but later in the spring Statlu Creek will dry up and the alternate put in on the Chehalis River will be the better option. There is a report of using this put in at a very low level of 9.08m (~15cms). A better entry level low-medium flow is around 9.5m (~35cms). At this level the Chehalis is class III with one IV- rapid; III+/IV- if starting on Statlu Creek. Above 10.0m (~90cms), the run transforms into excellent read and run bigwater class IV, where boat recovery could be very challenging. At 10.5m (~160cms), the boils will be getting bigger but expert boaters will still be having fun. As flows approach 11.0m (~300cms), the river remains runnable but is essentially in flood with the associated serious hazards. It is during the fall and winter that big rainstorms and atmospheric river events truly bring this watershed to life; you'll need a big warm winter rain for flows to bump above 10.0m. The water colour at the takeout can suggest which branch is providing more water: Chehalis (clear green), and Statlu (brown tea).\n2020 hydrograph and median for CHEHALIS RIVER NEAR HARRISON MILLS (08MG001)\nAccess is often possible year round, although some years the logging roads on the shuttle may be snowed in. The put in is only at 150m elevation, and the highest point on the shuttle is just below 300m. To get to the take out from Vancouver, follow Highway 7 east to Harrison Mills, turn left at the Sasquatch Inn onto the paved Morris Valley Road, and follow to the Chehalis River Recreation Site on the left just before a bridge over the river. The usual take out is on river right just above the bridge; try to park out of the way as this is a heavily used area. The gauge is just a short walk upstream. Total driving time from Vancouver to the takeout is 1.5-2 hours. To get to the put in, backtrack to just before Highway 7 and turn right (North) onto the Chehalis FSR. After ~15km you will cross a bridge over Statlu Creek, where the most common put in is upstream of the bridge on river left. To get to the alternate put in on the Chehalis River, stay right after the bridge, drive up a a small hill for ~1.6km, turn right on the first logging spur and follow ~400m to a small gravel pit, where a steep trail leads down to the river. The shuttle should take about a half hour each way.\nClose up of the put in options: Statlu Creek from the west, and the Chehalis River from the north.\nAt the Statlu Creek put in bridge, the rapid just upstream is indicative of the difficulty down to the confluence: moderately steep boulder bars with the occasional hole to dodge. Further downstream there are some canyon walls in play, but no bedrock rapids. There is one long rapid confusingly also known as 'landslide' (there's one on the Chehalis too), which is often a site of carnage but usually fairly easy to collect gear at the bottom.\nIf Statlu is too hard for your group (III+/IV-), or flows are too low, the alternate put in on the Chehalis River is a good option with only a couple class III rapids to reach the confluence . Below the confluence, the river is predominantly class III pool drop, on the first major left bend beware a nasty pour-over in the middle of the river, it's hard to read from above so we suggest sticking to the outside of the bend and taking eddies to the right.\nBelow this after a right bend there is the old landslide rapid, this changes frequently and after a few years of having a crux move in it, the rapid changed in a big flood and is now read and run, it's also not really possible to portage this rapid unless you eddy out half way down it now, by which point you can see the rest of the rapid anyway.\nOne of the later rapids named Grayhound has a very large hole on river left at the bottom but is easily avoidable.\nAt high water (over 10.0m), the whole run turns into a quality fast and boily class IV(+) section with the occasional monster hole to dodge; scouting and portaging are often not practical. The main hazards are boily pocket eddies against headwalls, especially the one river right at the base of the landslide rapid. The run is perhaps best at 9.8m as above this many features also wash-out.\nNo matter the flow, most of the run is far from the road with limited hike out options. Non shuttle drivers will often want to stay warm with dry clothes and a pint at the Sasquatch Inn after the run.\nPushing low water limits on Statlu Creek.

A series of class III-IV canyons is punctuated by powerful class IV-V ledge holes and one steep class V boulder rapid which is tricky to portage. The whitewater may be a little inconsistent, but that is made up for by the beautiful rainforest canyon scenery and several unique rapids.\nThe Chehalis River is a free flowing, low to moderate elevation watershed that is buffered by the respectably sized Chehalis Lake. While there is a modest snowmelt season from April to June, it is during the fall and winter that big rainstorms and atmospheric river events truly bring this watershed to life. At the peak of a rain event the Upper Chehalis will likely be too high to paddle, but it should drop in during the following days. With a tolerance for low water, it's possible that this is one of the last sections to drop out in the Fraser Valley, since most of the water comes from the lake at low flows. A recommended medium level is 9.7m on the staff gauge. The run has been paddled at 9.3m and reported to be more manageable. A level of 10.0m was medium-high for the first bit out of the lake, and would likely be doable for the remainder below the bridge, if you are willing to deal with the commitment issues of the crux rapid. Keep in mind that Statlu Creek confluences between this section and the gauge.\n2020 hydrograph showing the dynamic nature of the Chehalis watershed.\nAccess is often possible year round, although some years the logging roads on the shuttle may be snowed in. The put in is only at 250m elevation, and the highest point on the shuttle is just below 400m. To get to the recommended take out from Vancouver, follow Highway 7 east to Harrison Mills, turn left at the Sasquatch Inn onto the paved Morris Valley Road, and follow to the Chehalis River Recreation Site on the left just before a bridge over the river. If you have enough daylight, it's better just to combine your paddle with the classic Lower Chehalis (III) and take out here on river right near the gauge. Total driving time from Vancouver to the takeout is 1.5-2 hours. To get to the put in, backtrack to just before Highway 7 and turn right (North) onto the Chehalis FSR. After ~15km you will cross a bridge over Statlu Creek, stay right after the bridge. After climbing a small hill, the first logging spur on the right ends at a trail that can be used as an alternate take out for the Upper Chehalis; however, it is difficult to spot from the river and not really worth the steep carry out. Carrying along the Chehalis FSR to ~20km, stay right at a Y to follow the Chehalis-Fleetwood FSR (unsigned?) down to a bridge over the river. Take a quick look upstream here to scout a natural weir hole. After the bridge, stay left onto Chehalis South FSR (unsigned?), up a steep hill, and down the first branch to the left to a neglected campground near the lake. The shuttle should take about 1 hour each way.\nPaddling out of the lake, a short section of class II quickly leads to one of the optional class V rapids. It's a tricky entrance into a steep ramp ending at a boxed in hole. Many people will portage this drop, so while scouting on river left leave your boats on a gravel bar ~50m above the drop, across from a small creek river right. To portage, follow this creek up through some devils club, looking for an opening to the left into a crack, down which you can lower boats back to river level. The first small ledge after putting back in has a bit of commitment factor, but it usually goes much better than it looks. Downstream is a beautiful class III-IV canyon, most of which can be boat scouted while being mindful for wood. After ~2km, get ready to run the weir hole that you scouted from the bridge. Swimmers and gear often float out into the large pool below the bridge, which makes a good bail point if you've had enough. Continuing below the bridge, the river progressively builds from class II to III to IV over the next ~4km. At some point, the gradient will markedly increase into the crux rapid of the run. This steep class V boulder rapid can be portaged over boulders on the right; unfortunately, there is no obvious way to scout or access the start of the portage without first running part of the rapid. One option is to do a short carry on river left past the entrance, and complete a pushy ferry through boulders to the right side. There is also a report of this rapid being portaged somewhere high on the right side. At this point you are in a >100m deep forested canyon, and while not totally boxed in, the commitment factor is not trivial. Immediately below the steep boulder rapid, get out on river left to take a look at an easily portageable, sweet 3m water boof into a pocket hole. Mellow water leads to the last big rapid on the run, a nice class IV boulder garden. At this point, either look for the upper takeout that you would need to have scouted beforehand, or preferably just paddle out through the classic Lower Chehalis (III). In total you will have paddled ~16km: Chehalis Lake to bridge (~2km), bridge to Statlu confluence (~6km), and Statlu to take out (~8km).\nPut in on Chehalis Lake\n\"Holy Roller,\" an optional class V chute immediately below the lake.

Some difficult portage options in spots; the hardest rapids have desperate portage options.\nTime\n3 hours.\nWhen to Go\nWinter rainy season.\nGauge\n6.91cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:20)\n!\nA large landslide occured on the Chemainus at the start of the second canyon during the winter of 2017. Some rapids were lost. Fortunatley, a flood six months later in the fall cleaned up the landslide debris - the rapids came back, and as a bonus, the former mandatory portage filled in and is now runnable!\nThe Copper Canyon of the Chemainus is a fun, moderately difficult whitewater run flowing off the southeastern side of Vancouver Island. While much of the river is canyonized and there is great whitewater throughout, the second half of the river boasts the most dramatic scenery and a handful of really high quality rapids, making it a run well worth putting high up on the hit list.\nLike many rivers on Vancouver Island, the Chemainus often flows at levels that are much, much too high to consider kayaking during the winter months when the island is pounded by moisture-laden Pacific storms. Appropriate flows are at relatively low levels, so this river can hold water for days as it slowly drops after a big peak. Bare minimum levels are around 16 cms. Normal low is 20 cms. Mid 20's are nice medium levels and 30 cms is starting to get high - the local crowd favour flows in the high 20's. At 35 cms the crux rapids are class V. It's doable higher, just keep in mind it's quite difficult to walk the biggest rapids at the end of the run.\nThe Copper Canyon is located about half way between Duncan and Ladysmith and it has a lengthy shuttle. To reach the take out look for Mt. Sicker Road off of Highway 1. Follow the road to a T-intersection and go right onto Cranko Road. At the \"end of public road\" sign turn left and drive down the dirt road until you are underneath a transmission line. This is the take out parking - a gated road goes down to the water.\nTo reach the put in, head back south on Highway 1 and then west towards Lake Cowichan on Highway 18. After about 8 km turn right onto Hillcrest/Hill 60 road and follow it along the obvious main branch until you can see the river close to the road on the left. At this point you will be in the unassuming Chemainus River Park where there are some parking spaces and trails down to the water. There is also intermittent access on river left, which is much shorter.\nCopper Canyon starts out as splashy class II. There is one notable rapid before the first canyon. The first canyon is straightforward, with one challenging rapid called Powerhouse. The scenery is particularly impressive. After an obvious break, the second canyon starts where a 300 foot tall wall appears on the right. As you paddle directly underneath the wall eddy out on the right for an easy portage around a nasty slot (runnable as of late 2017). The section below here is the best and most challenging section on the river. Come prepared to run this part as portage options are difficult. After the rapids subside take out on river right where the powerline/gas pipe crosses the river and walk up the short hill to where you parked. If you are fired up you can even hike up to run the falls that comes in on river left at the take out if the great whitewater upstream didn't satisfy your appetite.\nThe lead in to one of the first notable rapids called Powerhouse.\nRandom slide.  There is currently a terrible gaping sieve on the right side of this rapid.  This rapid disappeared in the 2017 landslide.\nThe massive river right wall at the start of the second canyon.\nIn the heart of the second canyon.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Runnable at high water all summer.\nGauge\n78.8cms\u2191 (Oct 21 05:45)\n!\nMost boaters have heard of the Chilko-Chilcotin-Fraser raft expedition. It's run commercially. There's a Hollywood movie called the White Mile about a rafting accident on the Chilko River. But questions remain. Does the trip have some of the most continuous rapids in North America, or is it just a bunch of flatwater? Is it in the forest or in the desert? Wilderness or roadside? Finally, is it a tightly held secret or a well loved classic? The answer of course, is all of the above. Most groups paddle the Chilcotin River as part of a larger Chilko-Chilcotin-Fraser or Taseko-Chilko-Chilcotin-Fraser expedition.\nRespect for the land\nIt seems likely the reason there is little beta about this trip, is that commercial and private boating groups do not want to see damage to the land and subsequent land use closures. The reason for this description is to inform the boating public about land status and best practices, so that this run can remain accessible for the foreseeable future. Right now, boating is a well recognized activity in the corridor, but there are several potential pinch points, and it is up to the boating community to be good stewards.\nThe put in region is in the territory of the T\u015dilhqot\u2019in National Government.\u00a0 \"We are the River People. The Ts\u0302ilhqot\u2019in people have fished ts\u2019eman (sockeye), Ja\u015d (Chinook), and tislagh (steelhead) since time immemorial.\" (TNG website).\u00a0 In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized TNG land title to a portion of their traditional territory, which is a different legal status to a land claim or reserve. The TNG owns and manages this area and has its own land guardians. Generally the TNG is welcoming to boaters, but it's a good idea to check their website or give them a call for current updates.\nT\u015dilhqot\u2019in Title Land includes the area between Tatlayoko, Chilko and Taseko Lakes as well as the Chilko River corridor down to Siwash Bridge below the Chilko-Taseko confluence. A more legible version of this map can be found at the T\u015dilhqot\u2019in National Government website.\nThe takeout region is in the territory of the Stwecem\u2019c Xget\u2019tem First Nation. \"For thousands of years, we have occupied and used these lands and waters to sustain our way of life. SXFN Rights include the Crown-recognized right to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes, and the right to hunt.\" (SXFN website). More specific to boating, in 2018, the SXFN acquired a private land title just downstream of the takeout at Churn Creek.\nPrivate land is common along the riverbanks. This description includes camping at sites which are open to the public. Any other potential campsites should be considered private land unless research is completed to show otherwise. Generally speaking, areas below the high water line are legal to camp, but this may not be true in TNG title lands and BC Parks.\nForest fire is a major risk in the semi-arid Chilcotin region.\u00a0 Don't add strain to fire crews by visiting during active fire fighting. Check for active fires and evacuation orders. Check for any fire bans, and even if there is not a fire ban, look at the local conditions and use common sense. Any campfires must be left dead out with water or burial.\nLandslides are common on the Chilcotin River, including large slides that can block the entire river for days. Farwell Canyon is known to the T\u015dilhqot\u2019in as Nagwentled \"place of landslides.\" Check Province of BC and TNG for any updates to the current situation and take care with campsite selection. Also refer to \"Appendix - Historical Landslides\" below.\nGrizzly bears are most common on the Chilko River, where they congregate in large numbers to feed on Sockeye salmon, but they can be seen anywhere in the region. Follow bear safe practices: keep a clean camp, manage scent attractants, cache food out of reach, make noise, travel in groups, carry bear spray, etc. There is a usually a recreation closure in September and October between Chilko Lake and Henry's Crossing to give the bears room to feed; check the TNG and BC Parks websites for updates. Other notable wildlife that could be seen include black bears, wolves, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, eagles, and pelicans.\nWater should be packed for the whole trip. The entire trip is in cattle country, and side creeks originate from appealing sounding places such as Scum Lake, Alkali Lake and Poison Mountain. There may be a water source at Bull Canyon Provincial Park on Day 2, but check with BC Parks ahead of time as it can be out of service. As for possible water treatment, the water in the Chilko River is the clearest; the Chilcotin River has glacial silt and progressively passes through more ranches and mudbanks; the Fraser is almost always brown.\nLeave no trace practices should be followed. Pack out all garbage including organics. River user numbers on the Chilcotin are at the point where packing out human waste is recommended.\nFlows\nThe Chilcotin has one of the most predictable river flows in BC since its sources are the enormous glacier-fed Chilko and Taseko Lakes.\nMost groups do the Chilcotin multiday as a late summer trip once levels taper off a bit in late August and September. High water trips in late June, July and early August are possible if you have the skills and know the lines, but many groups stay away at this time of year because boat recovery from a swim or flip may take several kilometers. Flush drowning is a real risk. Low water shoulder season trips are also possible, with the potential for night temperatures below freezing.\nTo plan the full multiday check the Chilko, Taseko, Chilcotin and Fraser gauges. All sections are runnable at all levels, but judgement must be used for your group. Refer to separate descriptions for the\nChilko River (IV)\nand Taseko River (IV) on BC Whitewater. Some groups choose to paddle the more technical Chilko and Taseko with unloaded rafts or kayaks, and launch the bigger gear rafts from the Chilko-Taseko confluence.\nA medium flow for the Chilko River is 50-70cms (CHILKO RIVER AT OUTLET OF CHILKO LAKE 08MA002).\nThe Taseko can be run a bit higher as it is not quite as continuous as the Chilko.\nA medium flow for the Chilcotin River is 100-200cms (CHILCOTIN RIVER NEAR HANCEVILLE (08MB012).\nThe Chilcotin River gauge with the longest record for statistics is CHILCOTIN RIVER BELOW BIG CREEK (08MB005); however, this gauge was discontinued after major floods near Big Creek in 2019. One limiting flow factor for many groups is the mandatory continuous class III-IV medium to high volume whitewater in Big John Canyon just above the Fraser confluence. It is difficult to stop, scout, or portage any of this section.\nLook for the FRASER RIVER AT MARGUERITE (08MC018) to be around 2,500cms for a low stress float out.\nA level of 5,000cms will be scary with 1m high breaking waves on eddy lines, 20km/h current, and the campsite at the takeout could be flooded.\nCHILKO RIVER AT OUTLET OF CHILKO LAKE (08MA002)\nTASEKO RIVER AT OUTLET OF TASEKO LAKES (08MA003)\nCHILCOTIN RIVER BELOW BIG CREEK (08MB005)\nFRASER RIVER NEAR MARGUERITE (08MC018)\nShuttle\nIt's a big one: 5 hours each way for the Chilko-Chilcotin-Fraser shuttle, 3 hours each way for the Taseko-Chilko-Chilcotin-Fraser shuttle. Mostly on dirt roads.\u00a0 Get a GPS and backcountry map that shows forest roads. Any car should make it, but high clearance is recommended, and if the roads are wet AWD/4WD will be nice to have. Fuel up beforehand in Clinton or Williams Lake, and also check the location and hours of gas stations on the shuttle route (e.g. Tl'etinqox, Redstone). Williams Lake is a small city and the best place to get groceries and supplies. You can call around the outdoor stores in town for a possible shuttle service, but there is no dedicated shuttle company.\nTo get to the takeout from the south, turn left (west) off Highway 97 just north of Clinton onto Meadow Lake Road, and follow this for at least an hour down to the Gang Ranch suspension bridge over the Fraser River. Shortly after the bridge, turn left as the takeout is located 1km downstream (south) in Churn Creek Protected Area, down a small 4x4 road to a steep sandy beach on river right of the Fraser River just upstream of the Churn-Fraser confluence.\nTo get to the Chilko River put in at Henry's Crossing, there are a few options depending on how much you like driving on dirt roads. Probably the fastest is west through the private lands of Gang Ranch to Big Creek, and cross the Chilcotin River at Hanceville arriving at Highway 20 at Lee's Corner. Another option is again through Gang Ranch, but head to Highway 20 by crossing the Chilcotin River at Farwell Canyon arriving at Highway 20 at Riske Creek. If you do this, stop at the Farwell Canyon bridge to scout Farwell Rapids. If it has been raining, the ranch roads can be very slippery, so avoid Gang Ranch, cross back to river left of the Fraser and take the Dog Creek Road north to Highway 20.\u00a0 Whichever way you get to Highway 20, follow it west to Tatla Lake. Turn left (southeast) and follow Tatlayoko Road and Henry's Crossing Road to a bridge over the Chilko River at Henry's Crossing, a common put in. Unless it's closed for bears, you can also put in 15km upstream of Henry's Crossing on Chilko Lake at Gwe Da Ts\u2019ih campground in Ts'il\u0242os Park.\nA typical Chiko-Chilcotin-Fraser shuttle route: through Gang Ranch, across Farwell Canyon Bridge, west on Highway 20, southeast at Tatla Lake to Henry's Crossing.\nThe route to the Taseko River put in at Davidson Bridge Recreation Site also starts west through Gang Ranch, but you stay on the south side of the Chilcotin River, all on dirt roads. There is nowhere to get gas or supplies. Do not try to short cut from Big Creek to Davidson Bridge, you have to drop down almost to the Chilcotin River at Hanceville before turning south again on Taseko Lake Road towards Nemiah Valley. You can also put in 30km upstream of Davidson Bridge at Taseko Lake with some exploratory 4x4 driving.\nA typical Taseko-Chilko-Chilcotin-Fraser shuttle route.\nOn the water\nThe total trip length from Henry's Crossing on the Chilko River to Churn Creek on the Fraser River is ~215km (Chilko-Chilcotin-Fraser). The total trip length from Davidson Bridge on the Taseko River to Churn Creek on the Fraser River is ~230km (Taseko-Chilko-Chilcotin-Fraser). For either option, late summer raft trips generally take 5-7 days on the river, plus shuttle. A typical high water kayak trip is 3 days on the water.\nImportant Note: The section between Hanceville and the Fraser confluence (Day 3 and Day 4) may have experienced changes from a large landslide on July 30, 2024 and resulting outburst flood on August 5th, 2024. The peak flow during this flood was estimated to be 3,000cms on the Chilcotin River, up to 30m above normal levels. This river description is all from trips before the landslide and flood.\nDay 0 - Drive to put in\nCamp at or shortly below the put in, as both rivers have significant canyons on Day 1.\nBe respectful of TNG title lands\nRiver left of the Chilko is private property from just below Chilko Lake until 10km downstream of Henry's Crossing.\nDay 1 - Either 50 km on the Chilko River or 65 km on the Taseko River - Bridge put ins to Chilko-Taseko confluence\nBoth the Chilko River (from Henry's Crossing) and the Taseko River (from Davidson Bridge) contain sections of medium volume continuous class III-IV rapids that can be difficult to scout.\nThe most challenging whitewater on both rivers is in the final 20km down to the Chilko-Taseko confluence.\nBidwell Rapids on the Chilko River and Taseko Falls on the Taseko River are class IV at all levels and can be difficult to recognize to eddy out for scouting.\nThe\nChilko River\nand Taseko River are described in more detail on their respective BC Whitewater pages.\nCamp at the Chilko Taseko Junction Recreation Site, which is on a high bench on river left of the Chilko River at the Chilko-Taseko confluence. 4x4 boat ramp.\nDay 2 - approximately 50km - Chilko-Taseko confluence to ranchlands\nSemi-roadside class II-III and flatwater in ranch country.\nGap Rapids (III-IV): located under Siwash Bridge; a short constriction that gets boily at high water and also may collect wood\nChilko-Chilcotin confluence\nBull Canyon Provincial Park: roadside campground with possible water supply.\nAlexis Creek bridge. Basic supplies 2km away in very small town of Alexis Creek.\nCamp below the high water line on gravel bars, perhaps in the braided section between the road bridges at Alexis Creek and Hanceville. Most of the riverbanks from Siwash Bridge to Hanceville Canyon are private land or First Nations Reserve. At high water there are few legal campsites, but Day 2 and Day 3 can be combined.\nDay 3 - approximately 50km -\nranchlands to Big Creek\nHanceville bridge (Big Creek Road): boat ramp.\nHanceville Canyon (II-III): a limestone bluff on river left marks the start of read and run rapids for several kilometers before the river flattens out again.\nCamp on river right just above the Big Creek confluence, it is easy to miss as Big Creek Rapids are just below. This campsite backs onto Big Creek Ecological Reserve.\nDay 4 - 35 km - Big Creek to Chilcotin-Fraser confluence\nBig Creek Rapids (III+): located just below Big Creek confluence; read and run long braided wave trains.\nPothole Ranch cabins: river right just before Farwell Rapids. Damaged in 2024 floods. River access with a short hike to the road.\nFarwell Rapids (III-IV): located just above Farwell Canyon bridge and continue underneath; big hydraulics under the bridge at high water.\nJunction Sheep Range Provincial Park: river left from just below Farwell Rapids down to the Chilcotin-Fraser confluence; no services.\nBig John Canyon (III-IV): continuous rapids for the final 5km of the Chilcotin River down to the Chilcotin-Fraser confluence; scouting and portaging is not practical due to deep canyon.\nCamp on gravel bars near the Chilcotin-Fraser confluence.\nDay 5 - 30km - Chilcotin-Fraser confluence to Churn Creek takeout\nMostly flatwater with minor very high volume class II-III.\nTake out at a steep sandy beach on river right in Churn Creek Protected Area, 1km downstream of Gang Ranch suspension bridge, just above the Churn-Fraser confluence.\nIt is possible to continue further down the Fraser River, if you have a plan to deal with the class V rapids downstream (Big Bar, Bridge River, Hells Gate).\nChilko Lake.

The water is so clear the river shines blue the whole way down until it meets the milky water of the Taseko at the takeout which is a glorious sight!\nFrom September 1st -> October 31st 2021, the Chilko Newton Road was closed south of Henry's Crossing. to protect the Grizzly-Bear population, this is upstream of the Bidwell put-in but would prevent you from putting in at Chilko Lake.\u00a0 \u00a0 This may be an annual closure so please check with the First Nation if you would like to launch at the lake.\nhttps://www.xeni-gwetin.ca/post/for-immediate-release-chilko-newton-road-closure-protects-people-bears\nPoint of Closure in September 2021.\nThe Rec-Site and the river put-in and access is Title Land belonging to the people of Xeni Gwet'in First Nations.\u00a0 In times of Covid-19 and extreme fire-risk or on-going wildfires it may be worth contacting them to ask permission to access their land, and ensure it is safe and appropriate for you to be there.\u00a0 The guardians of the rec site are from the First Nation and were incredibly happy to see us when we happened to cross paths, they said they rarely see anyone at the site and were extremely welcoming.\nhttps://www.xeni-gwetin.ca/contact-us\nGetting there:\nMake sure you screenshot/print the details, especially the turn-off points whilst you still have service.\nThe roads you will be on will not be marked on Google Maps!\nFinding your way to the campground in day-light is significantly easier than night-time.\u00a0 Make sure you fill up with Gas in Williams Lake, the gas station in Alexis Creek may not be open. For this river trip it's highly recommended to bring a spare jerry-can of gas, a puncture repair kit, and an air compressor. Punctures have happened on both my trips on the shuttle.\u00a0 You are several hours drive away from the nearest town, and even an hours drive away from the nearest building once at the campground.\u00a0 No cell-service after Williams Lake and also even unlikely to even run into anyone else the whole time you're up there and you are in Grizzly-bear territory. \u00a0 A 4WD/AWD is essential for this trip, something like a Subaru Outback the minimum you'd want but trucks are better as you never know how bad a state the road will be in.\nTurn off Chilcotin-Bella Coola Hwy at Chilko-Newton Road (2nd left after Bull Canyon Rec Site), reset your trip counter here, after about 1.4km\u00a0 turn left down Chilko-Newton Airstrip Road, cross over a small river which is confusingly the Chilcotin River, and head through a couple of gates staying on the 'main' road through a farm, if you get to a building you've gone the wrong way. You'll drive by a large agricultural field on your right, keep left at any splits, and then the river will be on your left shortly after this field, don't cross the river itself (there is the Siwash bridge over the Chilko), keep the river on the left whilst you drive down a degrading road, in wet weather it can get very boggy and muddy, but we've got cars through it. At night you will have no idea you're even near the river if you're driving in.\nAt\u00a0 about 18km you should see a 'Road Closed' sign, with a left turn down-hill and in 0.5km you'll be at the Chilko-Taseko Junction Recreation Site which is the take-out and one of the most beautiful campsites you'll ever go to. The stars are incredible as you're in one of the darkest places you will ever go!\nThis road is NOT on Google Maps!\nTo get to the Put-in Head back to the Road-Closed sign, turn left, and drive for 24km.\u00a0 There is one crossing at Bidwell Creek at about 18km where a bridge has been long washed away which can be a challenge for some vehicles.\u00a0 Once you've gone passed this, and up a hair-pin bend, when the road comes back to the river this is your signal to look for the put-in.\u00a0 A small clearing with enough space to park a few cars should be obvious. Hike down the short steep bank to the river.\nRiver Level:\nChilko can be run very high and low, some of the best rapids wash out at higher flows so a good flow is somewhere in the middle. High water laps will be much quicker than the shuttle!\n7\n0cm/s+ High water\n50-70cm/s\u00a0 Ideal flows\n50cms/ and below, low water\nThe River:\nA big volume fun, mostly read and run river but always be on the look-out for wood.\u00a0 The tricky part is spotting Bidwell from before, it's about 5km into the run, there is kind of a rocky landslide area on the left just before.\u00a0 Scout on the left, it's a great view, there are some rocks on the left side at the bottom which is the main thing to avoid.\u00a0 You can run left of the rocks but don't recommend it. Setting safety at the bottom is better.\nBidwell Rapid\nAfter 3km of read-and-run fun you'll be at the White Mile rapid,\u00a0 a big long continuous wave train rapid with a couple of holes which are easy to avoid.\nThe White Mile\nEagles Claw will be the next rapid of note, which you can scout, there are 2 big holes to avoid normally run right to left. Enjoy the rest of the river which is easier big volume wave trains, a very cool Lava Canyon section, and then towards the end there is a new rapid created by a recent landslide which was great but will probably change a lot whilst it settles in.\nThe new Landslide Rapid - Graham Gerry - Mountain Cat Images\nThe last part of the river is much flatter and this is where you may be lucky enough to see Bears fishing in the river for salmon.\u00a0 In July you may find lots of lovely berries along the river banks, sometimes directly from the eddy.\nJaq boofing a beautiful spot before entering Lava Canyon\nTake out at the confluence with the Taseko, you can climb up on the hill between the rivers for a better view of the milky merging of the rivers.\u00a0 The Taseko is another fantastic run to do but the shuttle to the put-in is 160km drive from the takeout!\nThe Confluence at the Campground, Taseko River and Chilko Rivers meet to from the Chilcotin River\nWatch out for wildlife on this run and the shuttle!\u00a0 There is normally a multi-day section below here, the Chilko River becomes the Chilcotin River about 10km downstream (despite the Chilko being a larger the river, the river becomes the Chilcotin due to the Chilcotin River being longer upstream of the confluence), but due to an extremely large landslide in July 2024 at the time of publishing this guide that section is not recommended.\nhttps://www.bcwhitewater.org/reaches/chilcotin-river\nWatch out for curious bears!\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Low: 1.2 m (30 cms) and below. Medium: 1.5 m (50 cms). High: 1.7 \u2013 2 m (70 cms).\nScenery\n: It\u2019s not really a canyon, but an amazing run nevertheless. If it\u2019s your first time, be prepared for a long run where the rapids just don\u2019t seem to end.\nLength of Run\n: 10 km\nLength of Shuttle\n(one way): 7 km\nSpecial Considerations\n: Watch for wood. Continuous at high levels.\nDirections\n: For general directions to the Chilliwack River/Vedder Crossing see (7). Take-out is just downstream from where Slesse Creek joins the Chilliwack, approximately 20.5 km east of Vedder Crossing Bridge. To get to the put-in follow the road east for about 7 km to a bridge across the Chilliwack. Park either at the camp spot across the bridge on river right (north side of road) or on the logging road that turns off to the right just before the bridge.\nDescription\n:\u00a0 Don\u2019t judge this run by what you see from the put-in. You get a couple of kilometers of very gentle warm-up ripples. The ripples give way to some class III drops. The fun starts soon after a headwall on the right. The first significant drop, \u201cDouble Whammy\u201d, has a ledge on the right and a couple of holes on the left side. After a slight left bend follows \u201cShotgun\u201d (also called \u201cGun barrel\u201d), recognizable by a big rock at the bottom left. Most often this is run from the left side towards the middle. After the river makes a right turn, a second headwall comes up on the right (\u201cCarousel\u201d). \u201cPin Ball Alley I\u201d is just what its name suggests, a long boulder garden, and pretty bony at low levels. At the bottom of \u201cPin Ball Alley I\u201d the river makes a slight left turn. Watch for a rock outcropping on the right side. On the downstream side of this rock is a plaque remembering Mel Zajac, a paddler who died here in 1986. The drop immediately below is named after Mel and has at medium to high levels a dangerous hole on the left side. Scout \u201cMel\u2019s\u201d from the right bank. The next drop is marked by old bridge foundations and has several ledges and holes. Next follows \u201cGodzilla\u201d a straight forward looking drop that ends in a rather dynamic hole. \u201cPin Ball Alley II\u201d, \u201cCable Pool\u201d (gauge on river left) and \u201cSurprise\u201d are all similar. They start out wide and get narrower and steeper, are peppered with lots of waves and holes and end in a couple of big waves above a pool. At the bottom of \u201cSurprise\u201d is a great play wave at the right levels. Don\u2019t let your guard down just yet; there are more drops to come, holes to avoid or to play in. Finally, just after Slesse Creek enters from the left is the take-out. You will face a new challenge here: dodging the lines of eager fishermen.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Put-in is at Pointa Vista/Osborne Rd at kilometer 7 on Chilliwack Lake Rd from Vedder Crossing. Turn right (south) and park at the dead end well out of the way of residents. Since there have been problems with break-ins consider parking your vehicles on Chilliwack Lake Rd. The take-out is just above Vedder Crossing Bridge. Here the river is braided and convenient take-out locations change from year to year. Make sure you park your vehicle off the road.\nDescription\n: This is a good beginner run, but be aware of log jams, strainers and sweepers. There are lots of eddy lines to practice turns and small wave trains and holes to hone boating skills.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

High: 2 m, medium: 1.6 m, low: 1.3 m.

There are almost always log jams in the lower section. Continuous with few eddies at higher levels.\nGeneral Directions to the Chilliwack River:\nFrom Vancouver drive Hwy 1 (Trans Canada Hwy) to Chilliwack. Take Exit 119 and drive Vedder Rd South towards Sardis and Vedder Crossing.\u00a0 You can also take Exit 104 and get via Yarrow to the Vedder Crossing Bridge. This takes about 1hr15min.\nDirections:\nTake out is at a bridge on Chilliwack Lake Road 27 km from Vedder Crossing. Follow Chilliwack Lake Road East for another 10 km to a small settlement. Turn right. The first option for a put-in is to drive straight until you get to the river. For a second possible put-in further upstream turn left and then right. Park at the dead end. You will cross a small creek before you get to the river just below an old bridge foundation.\nDescription:\nIf you have chosen the upstream put-in the run starts with a little slalom around a couple of ledges (IV-). The river eases somewhat after you pass the lower put-in about 1 km downstream but stays entertaining with continuous and fun boulder gardens. After 10 km a bridge crosses the river. River-wide log jams occur frequently near the island below this bridge.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Low: 1.1 m. Medium: 1.4 m. High: 1.7 m.\nScenery\n: Even with lots of houses and trailers on the banks you will see plenty of nature when you are on the river. Watch for eagles and salmon, especially when the latter are running. Lots of paddlers and fishermen.\nLength of Run\n: 12 km\nLength of Shuttle\n(one way): 10 km\nSpecial Considerations\n: Watch for wood. Tamihi Rapid is the most difficult drop on the run and class IV at medium and higher flows. Scout and, if you choose to, portage on the left. When the salmon are running fishermen frequent the Chilliwack River. Although most are friendly, it is not uncommon to encounter some who are rather hostile. Don\u2019t take it personally - they are probably hostile to other fishermen too. It is best to just move on and let them be or better yet, paddle the upper two runs where fishing is prohibited.\nDirections\n: For general directions to the Chilliwack River/Vedder Crossing see (7). The take-out is on the left just above \u201cTamihi Rapid\u201d or if you prefer to run the rapid, on the left just above the bridge about 11 km east of Vedder Crossing. To get to the put-in follow the road east for another 10 km to just below the Chilliwack - Slesse confluence. There is plenty of parking on the left (river) side of the road. Alternative put-ins are at Allison Pool (15 km east of Vedder Crossing at a campground) and at Thurston Meadows (another campground 18 km from Vedder Crossing).\nDescription\n: If you start at Slesse, there is not much time for a warm-up. The first drop below the put-in has changed considerably in the last couple of years and is now pretty exciting. Further downstream the river takes on pool-drop character with long flat stretches, some nice drops and short boulder gardens. Look for a good play and an ender-spot on the left at \u201cAllison Pool\u201d. An interesting rapid is at \u201cTrailer Park\u201d. The last drop in this run, \u201cTamihi\u201d is significantly more difficult than the rest of the rapids in this section. Scout it or portage it on the left (possible on the right too). Slalom racers are often practicing on the gates in this rapid.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Low: 1.1 m. Medium: 1.4 m. High: 1.7 m.\nScenery\n: Although this is a populated area, there is plenty of nature around you. At the right time of the year you can see many eagles and salmon.\nLength of Run\n: 3 km\nLength of Shuttle (one way):\n3.5 km\nSpecial Considerations:\nWatch for wood and fishermen. There have been problems with vehicle break-ins and disgruntled residents at the take-out at Pointa Vista/Osborne Rd.\nDirections:\nFor general directions to the Chilliwack River/Vedder Crossing see (7). Park at Tamihi (kilometer 11 on Chilliwack Lake Rd from Vedder Crossing). Put-in either above or below \u201cTamihi Rapids\u201d. There are two possibilities for the take-out at Pointa Vista: (1) drive back on Chilliwack Lake Rd across the bridge towards Vedder Crossing (west) for 3.5 km. Turn left on Osborne Rd. and drive to the dead end. Make sure you park well away from private driveways and exits. Take out on river right. (2) From the Tamihi parking turnout turn left onto Liumchen FSR before the bridge and stay on the left (south side) of the Chilliwack River. Drive about 3 km to a gate. The river splits in two arms at this take-out \u2013 make sure you recognize the spot and choose the left arm.\nDescription:\nIf you choose to put in above \u201cTamihi Rapid\u201d scout it on the way up. At higher water it\u2019s a busy class IV boulder garden that continues below the bridge. Around the corner there is \u201cCampground Rapid\u201d, which has some big holes on the left. Further downstream the river mellows but stays interesting with waves and holes all the way to Pointa Vista.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Just doing Redspring to Kettle takes about 4 hours, and there's still 9km to go to get back to town.\n150cms is high water for this section, currently not sure on the lowest end for this section.\nThe main crux of Gatlin Gorge is 5 drops in a committed canyon that at one point is very narrow.\u00a0 Once into the main part of this section you are a long way from a road, the last major rapid is at the confluence with Murtle River, and there there is 20km+ of flatwater to go!\nDrop 1 is a big S bend rapid with a lot of laterals and holes to avoid at the bottom through a tight canyon.\nDrop 2 has a big hole on the river right.\nDrop 3 is a shelf drop run down the center.\nDrops 4 and 5 are less significant and scoutable/portagable, you'll have to decide if these are worth it!\nThe run classically continues into the\nUpper Clearwater\nwith most paddlers who ran the Gatlin Gorge running the Kettle and ending up doing a fast lap of the\nClearwater Play-Run\ntoo.\nAlso in this area is the class V Raft River, both a full descent of the Clearwater and some of the Raft River by\nPierce Huser here.\nBeta from multiple paddlers and video footage, author has not run this section, please contact BCWhitewater to update an incorrect information or provide some photos for this guide!\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

(\nThe Upper Upper Clearwater\nis great at 'Low' Water)\nThe Gauge at the Take-Out Bridge\nThe take-out is very easy to find, just in town by the Bridge on Camp Two Road, you'll often find other boaters here in the summer.\u00a0 Continue driving up the road, turn right onto the Clearwater River Forest Service Road. There is parking around the Kettle Put-in or further down at Hole-in-the-Wall rapid. At the Kettle there is rafting put-on just below the 3 fingers rapid at a spot called \"The Mosh Pit\" as the eddy is often quite violent, you are not permitted to drive down the ramp and it's very important you don't block the ramp as the rafting bus uses it.\nEither put on just below the Class 5+ Kettle Rapid, or a little further down at 'Hole in the Wall' to avoid the more challenging 3-Fingers and Class 4 Wall rapid.\nIt's possible to run The Kettle at either low water or a very very hard line at higher water too.\u00a0 At all water levels there is a shelf down-stream that gives out horrendous beat-downs, and at highwater there is a house-size hole to avoid. At low water this is still a big water class 5 move!\nMonique Boag entering the Kettle - Photo Graham Gerry - Mountain Cat Images\nThe first rapid is 3 fingers, all channels can be paddled at different water-levels, right side has a fun boof, left side has a chunkier wave-hole that at low water can give a surprise surf to playboats.\u00a0 You'll then pass the rafters put-in at The Mosh Pit, which at high water is a big wavetrain.\nThe Mosh-Pit\nNext you arrive at the Wall Island, the left side is generally easier, a huge wide wave guards the entrance, it's far friendlier than it looks, you run down passed a hole and then just downstream on the right is the 'German Basher' Wave which has a small hole behind it, and can be surfed.\u00a0 The right side of the island is generally only run at lower water and has some shelfs that create some sticky holes.\u00a0 You can inspect from the right, but it's tricky to see it all. Once the channels re-join you arrive at an eddy with the 'Hole in the Wall' rock.\u00a0 This is a friendlier put-on for those who are more in the class 3 territory.\nMike Shipp at 3.5 on the bridge gauge, The Wall Rapid - Graham Gerry - Mountain Cat Images\nAndrew Cline at 0.0 on the bridge gauge \"The Wall\" rapid at very low water - Graham Gerry - Mountain Cat Images\nThe river is then a series of long rapids with wide waves to drop on to and surf, lower water generally makes more waves with higher water having huge wave trains that feel quite continuous.\nLong-boat Surfing on the Clearwater\nShortly after Goose/Turkey Rock (big rock on left side of the river) there is a towering fast wave on the left which is always a challenge to catch.\u00a0 Not long after a slight constriction into a pool signals you're at Pink Mountain.\u00a0 Eddy out on the left and you can then spend hours dropping in to Pink Mountain Wave and then portaging back up to do it over and over again.\u00a0 Pink is surfable around 3.0 to 3.85 on the bridge gauge, which is around 300-420cm/s on the online gauge, best around 400cm/s.\nRoko Huser Surfing Pink Mountain - Graham Gerry - Mountain Cat Images\nRoko Huser and Noah Halowski surfing a Green Pink Mountain - Graham Gerry - Mountain Cat Images\nOn the opposite side of the river at lower water there is the Little Pink hole, which is a shallow freestyle spot.\nMany more wave-trains follow with some boiley points. It's possible to put on and run the last 1km or so for people who want a Class II+ experience.\nTake out on the right just before the first bridge. Please don't use the rafting take-out at the next bridge.\nThere is a long section above the play-run which is no-longer accessible due to a landslide, hopefully one day the road will reopen.\nWhilst you're in town I highly recommend you drive into Wells Gray Park and visit a few of the Waterfalls including the stunning Helmcken Falls, you will not be disappointed!\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

You will cross the Murtle River and don't confuse this for what you are going to paddle, it has a massive unrunnable waterfall downstream, but is worth a stop to check out Dawson Falls (which has been paddled). If you arrive at the \"boat ramp\" you've gone too far up the lake.\nAt the lake there is parking near the campsite and there's a nice spot to launch just by the cafe, the take-out is on your route up near Baileys Chute, two options of parking, one on the road left about 1km below the rapid or one on the right about 100m before Baileys.\nPut on at Clearwater Lake, and look out at the horizon line at the edge of the lake.\u00a0 Finding the best line here is tricky, there are many to choose from.\u00a0 You can scout from river right but you've got to paddle back up the lake to get across to your probably line choice somewhere down the middle.\u00a0 Or go hard river left (without going passed any major islands), you can scout, and send people off a lip on the left side of Osprey Falls.\u00a0 Beware... at one point of the lip there is a large boulder to piton (visible in the far left of the photo below), it has destroyed boats so be sure you avoid that part!\nFionn Graf - Osprey Falls - Graham Gerry - Mountain Cat Images\nShortly after Osprey Falls there is a small creek which enters from river left in dramatic style. It used to be possible to walk up here and huck the drop, but to do this now you need to take out at a small eddy at the last channel from Osprey Falls and walk up. If you've already floated down to the falls it's too late, it's possible to ferry across the river and paddle/hike back up to get back to the eddy but it'd be a lot of effort.\nSven Perschmann doing a switch cartwheel down Falls Creek Falls - Photo Graham Gerry\nThen follows a few kms of class 2 which feels very chill then the river builds into several large wave-train rapids which are read and run and rather fun.\u00a0 The river then becomes fairly continuous big volume wave-trains for about 2km, lots of fun waves to catch.\u00a0 The river will mellow out and just around a right corner a horizon line will greet you at Myanth Falls.\u00a0 You can scout either side and there are many line options here, river right being the most challenging line.\u00a0 A few ledges lower down make for a 200m long rapid, could be portaged either side. Generally scout on the left first to see the rapid, then go over to the right scout the right line, once you are there you are fairly committed to either running the right line or portaging.\nDaniel Helm and Rebekah Richardson Duffy running Myanth Falls - Many Line choices - Photo Graham Gerry\nSome more boogie water and you're up next at Donkey Falls/Marcus Falls.\u00a0 You can scout either side, easily from the left side where there is a trail to the take out for those that don't want to run the lower drops, or just want to portage Donkey.\u00a0 The left side is fast ramp move into a boof, the right side can be dropped down to for a closer look and then a couple of steeper drops.\nWill Grauer running Donkey Falls - Photo Graham Gerry\nNatalie York sliding down the left line - Photo Graham Gerry\nRichard Maggs running an unusual center line on Donkey Falls - Photo Graham Gerry\nBelow is a fun Staircase Rapid with some big holes, start on river right, you want to push left to eddy out above Bailey's Chute.\u00a0 If people swim on Staircase typically their boats will go down and run through Baileys, and the swimmer will end up on river right above Baileys and involve a time-consuming bush-whack down to below Baileys.\u00a0 If you have nervous boaters who are already portaging Donkey Falls they can continue down the trail to Baileys instead.\nBaileys Chute - Photo Graham Gerry\nThis rapid is optional, you can take out here and walk to the vehicles, or take out after the rapid.\u00a0 There is a large boulder which creates piton/rooster tail that you want to avoid. This drop is Class 5, Nouria Newman had one of her worst swims here apparently.\nAn alternative take-out is about 2km downstream at a rec site.\nConsider stopping at Helmcken falls on your way home, the afternoon sun often creates the famous rainbow.\nThe mighty (and un-runnable) Helmcken Falls - Photo Graham Gerry\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

This river is a great 2 day run that can be accomplished easily in a normal weekend, and though it doesn't have the hardest or the best whitewater in the area, the high mountain scenery is in a class of its own. The trip can be extended by taking an extra half day to paddle over to the receding Clendinning Glacier where you can hike up, over and around the true source of the river.\nFlows on the Clendinning are easy to determine by using the\nElaho gauge\n- the Clendinning is a major tributary of the Elaho. The normal season is in late summer and early fall - it is too high for much of the summer and the put in lake likely remains iced over when it's still low enough in the spring. 60-70 cms on the Elaho is minimal - there will be a lot of rocks, particularly on the first day. Optimal medium range flows are 80-150 cms. High water trips have been run with minimal portaging but the difficulty increases accordingly - expect a class V trip as levels approach 200 cms - it is unreasonable much above this level. This river tends to cause epics - don't underestimate it.\nGetting to the put in is not as simple as it used to be before Whistler Air changed ownership. You have to fly in to Clendinning Lake, but the obvious choice Whistler Air/Harbour Air usually won't do the flight any more. Reports say that flying with Tyax Adventures currently presents the most affordable/only possible option, but do some research for other providers. The shuttle to the take out is long, especially if you have to return to Whistler for vehicle recovery. The take out is somewhere along the Elaho FSR, far up the Squamish and then the Elaho valley, where the road is close to the river. The Clendinning/Elaho confluence is around the mile 60 marker - the road is far from the river at the confluence so you'll have to find a spot somewhere lower down to park your vehicles - there are several options. It is at least 2 hours from the take out to Squamish.\nWhen you fly in, give yourself enough time to paddle over to the Clendinning Glacier to do some hiking. There is nice camping on Clendinning Lake and the mountain scenery is great. Out of the lake the river is small (and manky if it's low) until the first major tributary. The whitewater ramps up slowly - you will eventually reach the first steep section that starts with a burly 6 foot ledge. Run it or portage on the left and immediately go over to river right. The next 100 meters is a manky boulder choker that can be snuck down the right side - a quick lift over the most choked out portion of the section gets you back on the water with almost no portaging. Some groups have spent hours portaging this whole section.\nThe whitewater continues for another few kilometers, eventually giving way to flatwater - this flatwater is the obvious spot to break for the night and there is ample good camping. Giving yourself 3 to 5 hours should be more than enough time to get through day 1.\nStarting slowly, the whitewater on the second day is much better than the first. Things are generally very continuous boulder rapids that build in difficulty until the river suddenly flattens out to easy busy water and finally flat water down to the confluence with the Elaho - expect 3 to 6 hours to get through day 2. The volume doubles once you get on the Elaho and fast current will quickly bring you through the wide valley down to wherever you parked the cars and the inevitable bumpy drive back to civilization.\nA fine shuttle vehicle to reach the put in.\nMountain scenery on the flight.\nSoaking up the views, nearing Clendinning Lake.\nSaying goodbye to the shuttle.\nClendinning Lake scenery.\nThe glacier.\nThe scene shortly after coming out of the lake.\nScouting some of the steep boulder madness.\nIn the heart of the boulder choker near the start of the run.\nBelow the boulder choke things get better quickly.\ncldng18.jpg\n338 KB\nInto the flats.\nCamping out in the mountains, end of the first day.\ncldng21.jpg\n351 KB\nA serious snowbank remains - August 29, 2010.\nEasy boogie on day 2.\nThis is the biggest rapid of the trip - it kind of all looks the same.\ncldng26.jpg\n295 KB\ncldng27.jpg\n316 KB\nFinishing up - one of the last good rapids.\nThe long shuttle = creative shuttle driving.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Steep, continuous rapids in a deep canyon with cheap and easy logistics.\nClass\nIV-V\nScouting / Portaging\nEverything can be scouted and portaged.  The day of whitewater is long and there is often the need for some aggressive boat scouting.\nTime\n2 or 3 days.\nWhen to Go\nAugust and September.\nGauge\n89.4cms\u2191 (Oct 21 05:40)\n!\nContributed by Ali Marshall\nThe Grand Canyon of the Clore is a classic late summer fly in multiday near Terrace. Flowing through a huge canyon, the Clore is packed with amazing scenery and great whitewater. On top of that, the logistics are relatively simple making this trip an easy one to pull off. It runs at the same time of year as the Stikine and the Iskut Rivers further north, giving you one more reason to make the long drive up in the late summer and early fall.\nThe Clore at normal flow levels is a great class IV-V run. The canyon can be paddled at a fairly wide range of flows, but at high levels you should expect a continuous class V challenge. It's important for groups to pay attention to the weather forecast to avoid getting trapped by rising water levels as rescue from the canyon would be very difficult. The Clore is a tributary of the Zymoetz (aka Copper) River, which has an\nonline gauge\n. 100-150 cms appears to be the sweet spot.\nThe trip is often done in two days but it is recommended to maximize your time in the wilderness over three days by paddling all the way out to the confluence of the Clore and the Copper.\nThe two day take out is hard to find - expect to have to use your river sense to find it as the logging roads in this area change frequently. As of 2015, begin by driving up the Clore FSR to 17.3 km (0.3 km past the 17 km marker), and then turn left onto branch 17000. Drive for 0.7 km then turn left again. After about 0.5 km is where the cut block you will be in is closest to the river. Walk to the river and clearly mark your take out with flagging tape. Again, this information may not be accurate. It's fair to say you should just find a take out at about 17 km up the Clore FSR however you can.\nThe three day logistics are much easier. Leave your vehicle near the confluence of the Copper and Clore Rivers. There are many beautiful beaches and rec sites to choose from - choose whatever one you like the most. This trip makes for shorter days.\nThe put in is on Burnie Lake. Book your flight there with\nAlpine Lakes Air\n, based in Smithers. Their\nTurbo Otter\ncan take 7 people and kayaks for a very reasonable price. Once arriving at the lake, you have an easy day of flat water paddling until you reach camp 1. Watch out for moose here, there have been several close encounters. Camp 1 is a beautiful but ominous spot. A large flat gravel bar makes for perfect camping but below you loom huge canyon walls and a violent looking rapid. Once scouted the first rapid is in fact very runnable and kick starts a long and action packed day of whitewater.\nDay 2 is long. It helps speed things up if one of your team has done the section before. Boat scouting is the theme of the day. If you are inspecting every drop, you will make slow progress. The rapids are mainly comprised of lots of class 4 and 4 + moves, but its continuous nature makes it feel harder. There is only one rapid that is regularly portaged, and it is easy to spot and walk. Hiking out in some areas would be impossible. After 10 km or so the gradient eases and there are several km of almost flat water. Soon you will reach Flintstone canyon, a beautiful class 3+ bedrock canyon with some cool geology. Continue on until you reach your flagging tape at the take out.\nIf you want to continue to the Copper then the rest of the run is 3+ with one class 4.\nCLOREIOUS\nfrom\nTHE RIVER MILITIA\non\nVimeo\n.\nThe drop off on Burnie Lake.\nFlat water on day 1.\nCamp 1, above the Grand Canyon.\nThe scenery in the heart of the canyon.\nOne of the larger rapids at low water.\nThe same larger rapid at high water.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

By the time the Coal crosses into BC, the landscape is a more subdued forested limestone plateau. Even though the takeout is on the Alaska Highway, this is a remote corner of BC, and the put in is less than 100km from Nahanni National Park. The section Coal River described here (Lower Coal) can be accessed off the paved Alaska Highway and a reasonable hike in, for a total trip length of ~120km, almost entirely in pristine wilderness. The guidebook Paddling in Yukon also describes a fly-in trip to the Upper Coal, which is above this section. After the trip, you can check out the big water class IV rapids on the Liard River, as well as the nearby hot springs.\nFlows\nThere is no gauge on the Coal River, but you can get a general idea of flows from nearby gauges (Liard, Hyland, Nahanni). Flows generally rise high off snowpack melt into May and June, before gradually dropping through the rest of the summer. An early July trip (LIARD RIVER AT LOWER CROSSING @ 4000cms) was a fun medium high flow for kayaking. The guidebook Paddling in Yukon also describes this as a great August or September trip, including for decked canoes (LIARD RIVER AT LOWER CROSSING median flow 1100-1700cms). The actual flow in the Lower Coal reach will only be an estimated ~5-10% of these values.\nDaily Discharge Graph for LIARD RIVER AT LOWER CROSSING (10BE001).\nDirections\nNot exactly conveniently located, the Coal River is about 6 hours drive east of Whitehorse or Dease Lake on the Alaska Highway (BC97), or about 24 hours drive north of Vancouver. Once you are in this zone, however, logistics are about as easy as they get for northern rivers. The takeout is next to the paved Alaska Highway, just east of the bridge over the Coal River at km823, across from the gas station.\nThe crux of a trip on the Lower Coal may be finding the correct turn off the Alaska Highway to the put in. From the takeout at the Coal River bridge, drive west ~77km to a small bit of the old Alaska Highway on the north side of the new highway, around km900 (59.99509N, 127.60981W). This turnoff point is about 10km east of Contact Creek gas station, and 7km east of Contact Creek itself. Once on the old highway bed, quickly turn right (north) onto a dirt road. Follow this road ~15km NNE, ending at a nondescript turnaround near Pike Lake (60.09681N, 127.53799W). Early on in this drive, stay straight at a T junction; later, stay right at a Y. It's possible to get lucky and drive right to the trailhead, but a GPS, saw and 4x4 certainly can't hurt.\nRoute from the Alaska Highway to the lower Coal River via a dirt road, lakes, and portage trails.\nRiver Description\nThe Lower Coal River is more of an adventure trip than a whitewater trip. The breakdown is roughly 10km portaging along a lake chain, 90km of flatwater, 10km of whitewater, and another 10km of flat ending at the Alaska Highway.\nFrom the end of the 4x4 access road, hike ~200m north to the southern end of Pike Lake. From this point starting in the Coal watershed, it's about 10km or 5 hours of travel to the Coal River itself. However, the connecting creeks are mostly too small to paddle, so a combination of lake paddling and portaging is required. The portage route is on the north (river left) side of the Pike Lake outlet. Initially you can follow the lake/marsh, but then for the biggest portage the trail is up and out of the creekbed, and it's in bad shape (2022) with a lot of burned forest and blowdown. Look for sawed log ends to try stay on the trail. This tiring portage ends at a chain of five or more picturesque lakes. From this point it's best to paddle and drag your way down the creeks joining the lakes and the Coal River (60.11560N, 127.41788W). A map will be helpful in this section.\nOn the Coal River itself, the first couple days are FLAT, like read a book flat. Camping options are limited at high water but do exist, low water should have more sandbar options. A lot of this section has been completely burned.\nEventually, after a few sweeping river bends, the canyon entrance appears to the east. Starting at a tufa spring, several class II-III rapids continue for about 10km. The nature of the whitewater is mostly ledges and separated channels, formed by layered sedimentary rock. Some rapids are quite long, and portaging would not be practical. As the river bends back to the west, there is a constriction rapid (IV) that can be portaged on the left. Shortly after is the final ledge (IV), which can also be portaged on the left with a bit of sketchy rope work.\nThere's a great camping spot at the end of the canyon and then a quick float out to the highway. Or continue into the Liard to run the Portage Brule Rapids (IV).\nPike Lake at the start of the portage route into the lower Coal River.\nPike Lake.\nCrappy bits of the portage route.\nScenic bits of the portage route.\nOnto the Coal River itself.\nA waterfall partway through the flatwater section.\nTufa spring at the start of the whitewater canyon.\nLower Coal Canyon.\nLower Coal Canyon.\nConstriction rapid (IV) near the end of the canyon.\nFinal ledge (IV) at the end of the canyon.

Environment Canada, Coquihalla above Alexander Creek. This gauge seems prone to malfunctioning. If it works: Medium: 2.5 m. High: 3.0 m.\nScenery\n: Good, great mountain views, but next to highway. We have seen more moose than other groups of paddlers (so far 2 moose).\nLength of Run\n: 17 km and shorter options.\nLength of Shuttle (one way)\n: same.\nSpecial Considerations\n: Watch for wood especially from Carolina Mines down to Sowaqua. Rapids become continuous at high levels. Make sure to take out above the canyon.\nDirections\n: Take Hwy 1 from Vancouver to Hope. From Hope take the Coquihalla Hwy (Hwy 5) north to exit 183 (Kawkawa/Othello Road). The pullout under the highway bridge is the upper take-out. For a longer run drive 3 km downstream on Othello Road to a convenient pullout on the river opposite some houses (N49 22.873 W121 21.710). This is the lower take-out. There are also two choices for put-ins. The lower is at Exit 192 (Sowaqua) in the large open area near the river (N49 26.946 W121 15.993). To get to the upper put-in, continue north on Hwy 5 to Exit 195 (Carolina Mines). Follow the logging road upstream for about 150 m and put in at the small bridge (N49 28.711 W121 15.134).\nDescription\n: Much of the river can be seen from the road. The first 4 km from Caroline Mine to Sowaqua are mostly gravel bars with easy drops. Watch for wood especially in this section. After Sowaqua the pace picks up with a nice boulder garden. What you see below Sowaqua put-in is pretty much indicative of the rest of the run. At medium levels there are many one-shot waves to catch, boulders to boof and holes to play in. The last couple of kilometers before the upper take-out are quite mellow. Between the upper and lower take-out there are some good rapids particularly the first drop after the bridge. In case you are curious what you may find above the described runs, there are reports of epics involving lots of logs, boat dragging and waterfalls.\nCamping and Food\n: There are lots of restaurants in Hope. Try the Home Restaurant if you feel really hungry, but leave some space for the pie. Paid camping is available in Hope, free camping along the river off Pipeline Road (the logging road heading upstream from the Kawkawa exit).\nNon-paddling Activities\n: It is well worth visiting Othello Tunnels (part of the historic Kettle Valley Railway) and Coquihalla Canyon. It\u2019s a short 30 minute walk. You will see why Coquihalla means \"greedy or hungry waters\".\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Poorly suited for swimming!\nThe run starts with two bangs - two steep boulder drops (IV-). Put in below if you don\u2019t like the looks of them or if you find wood in critical places. Easier boulder gardens (III and II) and lots of small surf waves follow. The last third of the run is a float.\nFrom Vancouver take Hwy 7 (Lougheed Hwy) to Coquitlam. To get to the put-in, drive up Pipeline Rd. in Coquitlam past a gravel pit to a gate.

It hosts school groups as well as the Cowichan River Youth Kayak Festival. For an intermediate run not far from town, the Marie Canyon scenery actually feels wild. More experienced kayakers will still enjoy the eddy practice, the occasional surf wave, and a couple optional class IV rapids. Look for more details on this run and others in an upcoming guidebook from the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nFlows\nRunnable flows in the fall, winter, and spring are fairly consistent by Island standards, fed by the large Cowichan Lake. As flows drop into the summer, a weir at the outlet of the lake retains enough water to release at very low levels. At the current summer base flow of ~7cms, the section is still technically runnable, but will very bony and overrun by inner tubers. A better low-medium flow is around 20-30cms. Unexpectedly, Marie Canyon is not a great high water run, and at flows around 100cms many rapids are washed out.\n2020 hydrograph and median for COWICHAN RIVER AT LAKE COWICHAN (08HA002).\nDirections\nThe put in is just below Skutz Falls in Cowichan River Provincial Park, just over an hour north of Victoria on Highways 1 and 18. The take out is ~2.5km downstream on river left at a small parking lot for Marie Canyon, or further downstream at Stoltz Pool.\nRiver Description\nThose interested can put in above Skutz Falls (IV), but most paddlers will put in below the fish ladders, on some grassy rock ledges river left. After a warm up rapid, the river winds calmly around Horseshoe Bend. At the end of the bend near Horseshoe Bend Campground, the river enters a canyon with a series of class III rapids. Once you go under the old train trestle, paddle one more class III rapid, then make your way to the left shore to scout the optional takeout rapid (IV), which is usually run on the left. The right channel has been the site of several swimmer/tuber fatalities. A short steep trail leads up the river left bank to the Marie Canyon parking lot. If you are unfamiliar with the run, this final rapid and takeout should be scouted before putting on. Another option is to continue down a couple more class II bends to an easy takeout at Stoltz Pool Campground.\nSkutz Falls fish ladders.\nPut in spot below Skutz Falls.\nMellow floating between Skutz Falls and Horseshoe Bend.\nThe river starts to pick up again at the end of Horseshoe Bend, near the campground.\nS-Bends rapid at Horseshow Bend Campground.\nMarie Canyon is a popular with both whitewater canoeists and kayakers.

We parked at 11U 402819E 5771786N on Kinbasket Lake. From here we paddled across Kinbasket Lake and up Wood Arm to the end (approx. 25 km). From the end of Wood Arm we bushwhacked up and over the unnamed approx. 2125 m pass (426128E 5780464N) to the river.\nIMG_1760.jpg\n2.86 MB\nThe approach gives spectacular views of the Cummins Lakes, the waterfalls and the peaks of the Clemenceau Icefield\nThe River:\nThe river is mostly glacier fed from the Clemenceau Icefield. We were on the river August 15-16 2023 during a heatwave and the flows appeared high. This provided good paddling on the upper river but lower flows are probably preferred for the lower river, due to the lack of eddies at high flow and the difficultly in scouting from the bank.\nWe put on around 428915E 5778253N. The first km or two of the river were braided with fast currents and lots of wood including numerous river wide logs requiring short portages. The river soon slows down, the wood situation greatly improves and the next 14 km or so are a pleasant float meandering down a wide valley with occasional wood.\nIMG_1776.jpg\n3.59 MB\nView from the put-in\nIMG_1778.jpg\n2.73 MB\nThe upper river is braided with lots of wood\nIMG_1787.jpg\n2.19 MB\nThe majority of the run is a mellow, meandering float with great views\nAt approximately 420731E 5767680N the river straightens and the valley sides start to close. A small class 1/2 rapid marks the start of the whitewater section of the river. This was followed by approx. 0.5 km of fairly continuous class 2/3 whitewater. After this, the river slows down again momentarily and turns to the right (a large avalanche path comes in from the left at this point) before picking up again. At 420104E 5767679N there is a nasty bouldery rapid with a river wide log. I didn\u2019t scout the next section in detail but it appeared to be fairly continuous, fast class 3. At 419870E 5767850N the river turns back to the left, the valley widens and the river becomes more mellow again. There is a series of river wide logs in a rapid at 418990E 5767893N. Shortly after the valley sides start to close again and the river begins it\u2019s final descent down to Kinbasket Lake.\nIMG_1798.jpg\n3.81 MB\nThe whitewater section starts where the valley sides start to close in\nIMG_1803.jpg\n3.5 MB\nRiver-wide log in a rapid at\u00a0 420104E 5767679N\nIMG_1808.jpg\n2.43 MB\nRiver wide logs in a rapid at 418990E 5767893N\nAt this point, due to the high water and our dwindling supply of food and gas we hiked out on river right high above the river on game trails to join logging roads near the park boundary, and hiked down roads to the lake, so we have no information on the lower 2.5 km of the river. A 1991 survey (\nhttps://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/documents/r805/20214_1074551693621_40de1e44b2c9403b9312856c0ebad29a.pdf\n) describes it as\n\u201c\u2026steep (gradient = 3.7%) and entrenched, with boulder rapids making up most of the habitat. A 4 m high falls is situated about 20 m above the reservoir full service level..\u201d\n. From the end of the river it\u2019s an approximately 15 km paddle on Kinbasket Lake back to the car.\nThis a wild and remote river in a pristine old growth rainforest, with lots of wildlife. The bush is thick and scouting and portaging on the banks can be time consuming and difficult.\u00a0 It is probable that this trip gets a lot easier and less continuous than described at lower water levels. All the beta herein is based on one trip down the river so should be treated cautiously.\nIMG_1812.jpg\n3.38 MB\nOld-growth rainforest\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

This run, deep in the mountains north of Squamish, has an incredible mixture of everything that you've ever dreamed about that makes up class V kayaking. There are big waterfalls and high quality, sometimes mandatory runnable whitewater. It flows through a polished bedrock chasm that really defies description. Despite the extremely rugged environment, a short season and a lot of dealing when on the water, this creek truly is the flagship run for high adventure class V creekboating.\nDipper Creek is not something to take lightly. The big waterfalls on this run are not out of the ordinary; it is the incredibly rugged terrain and the inescapability of the Dipper Canyon that raise the stakes of completing the whole run. Were you to get hurt, encounter wood or lose your boat there are many places where you simply cannot portage, walk out or be rescued without a monumental effort. That being said, Dipper is fully runnable (with a few doable portages) from top to bottom - just put in the time to gather recent beta, scout appropriately and maybe have an escape plan and it's all good to go.\nAccess to the Dipper zone is along well maintained active logging roads. The\nmap\nshows clearly how to get there. When you get to the confluence of the Elaho and Squamish, take the river left road up the Squamish until you can cross the Squamish to river right. Dipper joins the Squamish on the right downstream from this bridge. Continue up the road to reach Dipper's access points.\nDipper has multiple access options. The furthest and easiest access is at a bridge over Carnival Creek, a tributary that reaches Dipper after about 1 km. Carnival, and then Dipper to the head of the Canyon is a terrible mank fest. Access to the upper Canyon works by hiking straight down to the river just past the 4 km marker on the logging road. To reach Dipper Camp and the access point to take out for the upper canyons and to put in for Vertigo Gorge take the second left after crossing the bridge over the Squamish. Follow the road to a large clear cut. The canyon here is steep but not cliffed out - you can go up and down from the river out the back of the clear cut, directly across from a landslide on the far side of the river. There is an animal trail that follows the rim of the canyon all the way to the Squamish that is found on the downstream end of the clear cut, allowing easy scouting of Vertigo Gorge.\nYou can take out at any of the access points, or you can thrash your way out anywhere if you can find a way to climb out of the canyon. If you complete the run you can hike back up the animal trail to Dipper Camp, or you can continue for about 1 km down\nthe Squamish\nthrough an amazing canyon where there is a short but steep hike up to the road. The best hike out option is marked with flagging tape (2011) and is found after you leave the canyon just below the Dipper/Squamish confluence behind.\nAnything but low water for Dipper will be too high. Late September through early November is the best betting time as it is usually snowed in while flows are low enough in the spring. Look for cool, clear weather in the days leading up to an attempt at Dipper. Keeping in mind the Squamish gauge is far downstream, under 80 cms seems to be acceptable. The Elaho is probably the best gauge to use, and it probably needs to be under 40 cms. These are rough guesses - small level changes will make a noticeable difference on this run, so get a visual of some of the critical points if you can. The upper canyons are best with a bit more water, the trade off being Vertigo will be spicy or too high. You can hike in to the run the waterfalls below Vertigo Gorge at summer flows, but everything else is much too high to attempt.\nIf you decide to start at the Carnival Creek bridge expect a lot of mank. This access is not recommended. The rapid of note on Carnival is a sweet 25 footer. You'll do some portaging and smash a fair bit of mank even once you reach Dipper, which continues all the way to the head of Dipper Canyon.\nThings start abruptly at the head of the canyon with the Double Dip/Big Dipper combo. The first is a two staged 40 footer and the second a 60 foot steep and narrow slide followed by a good 10 foot boof. They can be walked. If you continue below here you're generally locked in until the half way access point above Vertigo Gorge.\nThe canyon between the big entrance falls and the access point below Dipper Camp is a complex river puzzle, complicated by the deep inaccessible canyon that isn't easy to scout prior to dropping in. This is the least friendly section of the run, and if you drop in be aware there are many mandatory rapids and a few mandatory portages. As of the 2014 season it was navigable, but this can change depending on the state of wood and the rapids, several which have changed over the years.\nIt's impossible to describe this section in detail. You will encounter some good slides and many narrow rapids with names that play off the name of the Creek (Skinny Dip etc). The first major crux is Rowdy Flatwater, a long twisting slide with sticky holes and tough portage options. Below Rowdy Flatwater are more good rapids, and then a major narrowing into the middle gorge. Some of the rapids in this section have been changing and should they go from runnable to unrunnable it will render the whole section not good to go. Expect a sketcky portage in this section. This opens up to gnarly mank that leads to Vertigo Gorge. Hike up and out to reach Dipper Camp.\nVertigo Gorge is the heart of Dipper Creek. The easiest section of Dipper to run is from Dipper Camp through Vertigo Gorge and the upper Squamish. The crux of Vertigo is the 25-30 foot entrance waterfall. There is steep access in and out of the canyon at the lip of the falls. While there is a bad pocket in the landing zone, only the first person is without good safety as there is a decent eddy at the bottom where you can stop and get out of your boat. Vertigo continues through an intimidating series of bedrock ledges. After the gorge you'll run some boogie and then reach a slide to 40 called Rock Snot that appears to land on rock but has been run. Two more waterfalls, including the iconic Squamish confluence falls brings you to the end of the river, and the pleasant paddle out through the Upper Squamish.\nHave fun on Dipper, it is a monster and a classic - perhaps one of the greatest adventure creekboating runs ever.\nThe massive Douglas Fir that stands watch over Dipper Camp.

      "full_text": "BCWhitewater\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nAbout\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact\nBecome a member\nDuti River\nContributed by Daniel Helm\nWhat It's Like\nThe Duti offers challenging whitewater in a spectacular remote wilderness setting.\nClass\nIV+, depending on the level\nScouting / Portaging\nEverything can be portaged with varying levels of difficulty.\nTime\n3 days on the Duti and another 3-6 days on the Skeena depending on your choice of takeout.\nWhen to Go\nAugust / September. The first descent crew went in July at higher water. The first 2 days were full-on continuous class IV at this level and the lower canyons were very serious. Later in the year (August / Sept) the upper sections are a bit bonier but the main canyon becomes more manageable.\nThe Duti River forms the northern most extent of the Skeena drainage system and could arguably be considered the headwaters of the Skeena due to its length being similar to that of the Skeena itself above the confluence. Very little ground separates the headwaters of the Duti from the headwaters of both the Stikine and the Finlay Rivers. Situated between Tatlatui and Spatsizi Wilderness Parks, the Duti River has to be one of the most beautiful areas in all of BC. Combining this setting and wilderness experience with engaging and exciting whitewater, the Duti River should be on your bucket list.\nAccess the put-in by flying into South Duti Lake and being dropped off at an outfitter\u2019s cabin. Alpine Lakes Air out of Telkwa has a Cessna Caravan that can fit 6 people plus kayaks and gear. Consider postponing your first day on the water to hike up the ridges toward Duti Peak and admire the height of land your find yourself on, which is the headwaters of several BC major rivers: the Stikine (via Chapea Creek) to the north, the Peace (via the Firesteel and Finlay Rivers and Kitchener Lake) to the southeast, and of course the Skeena via the beaver swamps and marshes to the south which will be your first day of paddling. Fun side-note \u2013 old maps show South Duti Lake flowing north into the Stikine. Luckily it flows south into the Skeena.\nThe Duti River itself takes 3 days of paddling to reach the Skeena. These days are best broken up by camping somewhere near or before Gil Creek on night 1 (~26-32km from the lake), and at the confluence of Tzahny Creek on night 2.\nThe first ~20 km of the Duti are a shallow stream, meandering through beaver dams and shallow ponds. Enjoy the stunning mountain scenery. When the river leaves the open marshland and enters the forest the gradient picks up and the first major drop (named Hahn\u2019s Haul after a member of the first descent team) is encountered ~4km later. Best portaged or scouted on river left. Several km of low volume bedrock rapids and ledge drops follow, before reaching Camp 1 somewhere at or above Gil Creek.\nThe river volume picks up on Day 2 with several significant tributaries including Gil Creek and Malloch Creek. The nature of the river stays the same, with continuous boogie water broken up by the odd ledge drop or canyon section that are worth scouting. Save some energy for the mandatory portage at the end of this day around Tzanhy Falls, a serious cascading rapid starting with a large waterfall followed by a chaotic sieve rapid and another waterfall that lands on rocks. Portage on river right, and lower boats back down to the river below the falls. Camp immediately downstream at the confluence with Tzanhy Creek.\nDay 3 has plenty of action, but starts off benign with an easy 13km float. It picks up at Clamshell Falls, a runnable but hairy waterfall that can be portaged on river left through the forest, or river right by lowering boats down a small cliff. 4km later is another major feature, where the river splits into several channels over a series of ledges. The real excitement of the day begins 3 km later with Duti Falls: a 5m tall falls with a clean lead in. It leads directly into the boxed in, 1km long Duti canyon. At low flow the rapids in the canyon can be scouted at river level, but portaging or escape back out to the canyon rim would be very difficult and require some sort of rock climbing. At higher flow the canyon would be a very serious place to be. The entire canyon and falls have been portaged on river left through beaver swamps before lowering boats back down to the river.\nAfter the canyon some enjoyable boogie follows before arriving at the Skeena River where you will pass under an old creosote rail bridge. Camp here before continuing on down the Skeena to Hazleton (5 or 6 days) or to the Damsumlo Bridge (3 days) for an earlier take out. After the Duti most of your stresses will be over, but there are a few large rapids on the Skeena that one should be ready for, including some III+/IV- (level dependent) such as \u201cCut You a New Arsehole,\u201d a long compression rapid below the Sustut, \u201cHam\u2019s Slam\u201d a riverwide ledge below Odwyer canyon, and \u201cBrian\u2019s Hole\u201d above the Damsumlo bridge.\nCheck this video out from a trip that went in over the last week of August, 2023:\nhttps://youtu.be/f1yJ430w8xU?feature=shared\nLooking down at the headwaters of the Duti from the ridges above\nStunning vistas and shallow streams on Day 1\nHahn's Haul - Day 1\nOne of many ledge drops on Day 2\nDay 2 boogie.

When combined with the Dease River, it makes a trip about 220km long that can be paddled in as little as 3 days or stretched into 10 days. The float plane charter is pretty short, making this an affordable fly in option. Eaglehead Lake is spectacular.\u00a0 There are plenty of hiking opportunities here and further downriver with a little bushwhacking to alpine. Aside from a couple seasonal hunting camps, you will probably have the Eagle River to yourself. The paddle out on the Dease is flat and long, but has its moments.\nFlows\nFreshet usually starts in May and tapers off in July in the Cassiar region.\nThe nearest gauge is in a different watershed, but may be helpful for estimating flows (COTTONWOOD RIVER ABOVE BASS CREEK (10AC005)). A flow of ~40cms may suggest a low but acceptable flow on the Eagle River\nHistorical Max/Min/Mean Hydrometric Data Graph for COTTONWOOD RIVER ABOVE BASS CREEK (10AC005) [BC]. From a different drainage, but may represent flow conditions in the region.\nShuttle\nFly in to Eaglehead Lake from Dease Lake (50km). Packrafters may be able to find a way to hike in.\nTake out at the road accessible French Creek recreation site approximately 2 hours drive north of Dease Lake along Highway 37. There are earlier takeout possibilities that are not as straightforward.\nOn the water\nThe exit from Eaglehead Lake is shallow and will probably require boat dragging until reaching a couple tributaries. Most of the rest of the Eagle River is class I-II boulder dodging. There are two sections of easy class III: a short canyon above the confluence with the Little Eagle, and the lead in to the portage rapid. The portage rapid is a manky 5m waterfall with class III rapids above and below. There is no pool above the drop and it is on a blind corner. There is only one drop to portage, but the portage length could be 100-1000m depending on your comfort level.\nThe Dease River is flat, painfully so at times. Some stretches have awesome island camping, while other sections have steep brushy banks.\nKeep an eye out for wildlife. On my trip I saw moose, porcupines, beavers, eagles, swans, osprey, otters, a wolverine, and a grizzly bear.\nEaglehead Lake\nThe exit from Eaglehead Lake into the Eagle River\nHigh up on the Eagle River.\nHigh up on the Eagle River.\nThe first easy class III canyon above the confluence with the Little Eagle River\nIsland camping on the Eagle River.\nThe portage on the Eagle River\nRunout of the portage.\nEagle River below the portage\nEagle River below the portage\nMoose along the Dease River.\nIsland camping on the Dease River\nThe long paddle out on the Dease River\nConfluence of the Dease River and Rapid River\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Continuing 12 km past Moricetown, the river passes under the highway bridge. Immediately after the bridge there is a pull out. Park here and you will find a steep trail going down to the takeout.\nPut In\nTurn onto an unmarked gravel road located 400 m south of the Hwy 16 bridge over East Boulder Creek. Stay right immediately after the turnoff. Drive up a steep four-wheel drive road for approximately 1 km and park in the first pullout on the right side. Follow a trail down to the river and put in above the falls.\nGauge and Water Levels\nUnder the highway bridge there is a gauge rock in the pool in between the two drops (see photo). If this rock is submerged, the run is class 5. If the rock is visible but water occasionally laps over the top of it, the level is optimal. If half the rock is dry, then the run is moderate class 4. Any lower and the run becomes boney but it is still fun and manageable.\nJuly 2025 Update via Daniel Helm:\nEast Boulder has a new visual gauge. It hasn't been fully calibrated yet, but so far we are confident that 0.38 was a good \u2018medium\u2019 level.\nTo find the gauge, park on the Terrace side of the bridge and walk down to under the structure. Stand on the abutment as far upstream as you can, you can just barely see the gauge from here. The gauge is located in an eddy against the bedrock wall on river right, just upstream of the bridge. Zoom in with your phone and take a photo, and then zoom in some more (or bring binos) to try and decipher the level. Alternatively, you can likely scramble down to water level on river left and get a good view from there.\nGauge is on the upstream side of the bridge on river right.\nLooking at the gauge from under the bridge.\nDescription\nThe top drop is a clean 20 ft falls, followed by a long slot rapid. Scout this slot before putting on as it can collect wood; there is a trail on river right. The crux of the run 'Double Drop' comes next. Scout or portage on river right with difficulty. These ledges have claimed many swimmers. The tea cups come next, a beautiful triple drop. The next significant drop is a small boulder slot called Fickle Finger - it's manky at low water so portage on river right if uncertain. Some simple boogie water follows and then you come to the final rapid under the highway bridge.\nAt high water many of the ledges on this run form powerful hydraulics that could easily recirculate a swimmer. This section is also prone to collecting wood. Scout and set up safety.\nEast Boulder Creek map.\nRoad sign.\nThe final drop and the gauge rock.  This is medium high.\nThe first drop - Blue Fungus.

Best known as a class IV-V big water run.\nClass\nIV-V depending on level\nScouting / Portaging\nScouting is ok.  One of the biggest rapids is a must-run.\nTime\n1-2 hours.\nWhen to Go\nYear round (often snowed in during winter).\nGauge\n53.7cms\u2191 (Oct 21 05:45)\n!\nFear Canyon is an ominous name for a river. For this section of the Elaho at high levels it surely holds true - the run is a gauntlet of crashing waves and towering holes. It is a classic big water river. However, at low levels don't let the name get to your head - things get progressively easier as levels fall, and amazingly it remains runnable -\nand quality\n- even at minimum winter flows.\nAs mentioned above, Fear Canyon is runnable over a huge range of water levels. Accordingly, the river changes drastically at all the levels at which it is run. At the lowest levels of 20-40 cms (it doesn't get much lower) it is a fun class III-IV jaunt amongst the boulders that form enormous holes at higher levels - everything is easily managed at water level. The remarkable thing is even at these rock bottom flows the majority of the rapids are clean and well channelized.\nOnce things get up to 80-100 cms this run is starting to feel like a big river and the biggest rapids are certainly IV+. At 150 cms the river is pushy big water class IV-V - it is classic kayaking at these levels. Anything over 200 cms is generally described as terrifying in a few spots, but still doable for strong boaters. Make your own mind up about whether boating Fear Canyon at these or higher levels is worth it for you. It's been done successfully at at least 350 cms.\nAccess to Fear Canyon is along well travelled and well maintained dirt logging roads. Expect about a 1 hour drive from town to the river. From Squamish drive up the Squamish River - pass the Ashlu turn off and keep driving. You will eventually reach the Elaho-Squamish confluence. Stay left to head up the Elaho. The take out is at the first bridge that crosses the river - there is easy access just downstream of the bridge at the put in for the Elaho-Squamish raft run (near the gauge station). Drive upstream on river left - you can put in near where a small waterfall (it's obvious) goes under the road or you can continue up to the next bridge, though this usually means a portage (or sneak lines at high water) around 2 rapids just above the small waterfall.\nFrom the upper put in the river is relatively open - it is worth it if you don't mind the portaging. The two portage rapids are the 2 drops with house-sized boulders in the middle of the river - you can sometimes sneak them, but be sure to scout carefully from the road beforehand. Below the lower put in the river quickly rounds a corner and drops into the canyon.\nThings start off quickly with a ramp into a big pool. Everything can be inspected easily below here, and it is worthwhile at higher levels as some of the holes are huge. When you pass through a rapid with a big boulder in the middle at the bottom eddy out on the left or right to scout. This is the crux rapid of the trip, and if you want to walk it you might as well just walk out to the road. One more major rapid is left - it's just a stout as the must-run, but it has an easy portage. Enjoy the boogie down to the take out, and keep your eyes opened for a couple of good surf waves that come and go - a good way to calm down from the fear of Fear Canyon.\nRunning into the big one at a moderate level of 90 cms.\nThe entrance to the pinch.\nThis narrowing is fierce at high water.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Medium: Elaho 150 cms, Squamish 300 cms. High: Elaho 300 cms, Squamish 600 cms.\nScenery\n: Great views of hanging glaciers and jagged peaks, commercially rafted.\nLength of Run:\n10 km\nLength of Shuttle\n: (one way) 13.5 km\nSpecial considerations\n: The river water comes from all the glaciers you see and is therefore always freezing cold. Dress warmly. Big logjams have previously caused problems especially at higher levels. Whirlpools and boils at high water.\nDirections:\nFrom Squamish drive North on Hwy 99. Turn left on Squamish Valley Rd. at the Alison Lake Junction (10 km from Cleveland Avenue). The Squamish Valley Rd changes to the Squamish River Rd. 22 km from the turnoff you will pass a gate and forestry company information board. The road changes to gravel. Continue for another 18 km past the gate (mile marker 31.5) to a possible take-out (N50 02.777 W123 20.229). Walk to the river across a side channel (about 10 min) and make sure you recognize this spot. Another possible take-out is down a small logging road to your left just past Shovelnose Creek and before Turpid Creek (21 km from gate, mile marker 33, N50 04.258 W123 20.471). With a 4-WD vehicle you can drive down this dirt track for about 500 m to a parking area close to the river. This take-out is just below \u201cSteamroller Rapid\u201d and difficult to spot from the water. To get to the put-in go back to the main gravel road and continue for 6.3 km (27.3 km from gate). Turn right and drive over a bridge across the Squamish River. You are now driving along the Elaho River. First option for a put-in is about 1 km after this bridge. Turn left on a short track towards the river. For a longer run continue up the road to the first bridge over the Elaho (mile marker 39 \u00be), about 4 km past the bridge over the Squamish and 10 km from the take-out between Turpid and Shovelnose Creeks. There is a branch road and bridge to the left (N50 06.850 W123 25.613). Make sure you don\u2019t block the raft put-in when you are parking.\nDescription\n: About 1.5 km downstream from the upper put-in, after a left turn, is a long section with boulders and holes which leads into \u201cLogjam Corner\u201d (\u201cDevils Elbow\u201d). Here the river makes a sharp right turn around a rock buttress. On the left is a big eddy that is often packed with logs. At high water this is definitely a place to avoid! The drop below \u201cDevils Elbow\u201d is best run on the left since the water on the right pushes into a headwall and rock corner. Below this drop the river eases. The Squamish joins from the left about 4 km below the put-in. The next interesting drop \u201cSteamroller\u201d is about 6 km down from the confluence. This drop has a huge wave train. Watch out at lower levels when the waves can become holes. You can scout this rapid on the drive up, it is just below Turpid Creek. The upper take-out comes up fast after \u201cSteamroller\u201d, don\u2019t miss it. For the lower take-out continue through a couple more wave trains and watch for the occasional hole.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

There are several interesting sections of whitewater on this run that are draped in classic Canadian Rockies scenery. The Middle Elk, a short section of significant canyon with interesting rapids and a beautiful waterfall to start makes a great combination with other reaches of the Elk, or as a place to visit as a destination by itself.\nThe closest town to the Middle Elk is Elko, which is a small town about 15 minutes west of Fernie on highway 3. The river essentially flows behind the large sawmill in town. Use the\nmap\nto get your bearings. The put in is located just north of the lumber yard at a dirt pullout. Walk across the field to look at Leap of Faith. Slightly upstream, next to the obvious class 6 crack, is a way to climb down to the river above the falls. If you're not running the falls there is a steep rail track that descends to the pool below Leap of Faith, and the powerhouse fed by the water diverted from the Upper Elk. Climbing down this track is probably the scariest part of the whole run.\nTo reach the take out drive to the south end of the sawmill. When the road crosses a pipeline right-of-way, turn left and follow it until it goes up a steep hill. After the hill keep following the road a short ways until it ends at a beautiful overlook of the river. This is a fantastic camping spot. There is a steep trail that goes down to the river from here.\nThe Middle Elk is runnable over a wide range of flows. On the\nElk River at Fernie gauge\n, 20-30 cms is low, 30-50 cms is medium and 50-100 cms is high. Keep in mind the gauge is far upstream and its accuracy may vary. There is also a visual staff gauge attached to the powerhouse below the falls. 0.3-0.6 is low, 0.6-0.9 is medium and anything above 1.0 meters is high. The highest run people know of was at 2.6 meters (see high water photo below).\u00a0 Note that the dam and powerhouse are indefinitely out of service.\nLeap of Faith, the sweet waterfall at the start of the run, is optional. Accessing it requires a decent seal launch into an eddy that gets trickier as the level rises. It's only really feasible when the water is on the lower side for the canyon below. In normal flow range, the canyon is made up of mainly class IV rapids, and it is very scenic. The first rapid is called Rocket Eddy. The other rapid of note is called Corner Pocket, about half way down. The take out is located on river right at a large gravel bar when the river turns right and the canyon opens up. The trail up to the cars is steep and it will get you sweating.\nA view of Leap of Faith from near the put in parking area.

The biggest rapid has a tough but doable portage route.\nTime\n2 hours.\nWhen to Go\nLow water - early spring and late summer/fall.\nGauge\n13.5cms\u2191 (Oct 21 05:40)\n!\nThe Elk River is a classic East Kootenays run with great whitewater that runs through an interesting low-slung bedrock canyon. While an endless stream of photos of the near perfect waterfall called Leap of Faith found at the end of the upper run have raised the profile of this river in recent years, it's the collection of clean and challenging rapids upstream of that really make the Upper Elk shine. It is a very nice piece of whitewater. The only downsides are that it's quite short, and there aren't many other runs of similar difficutly close by at the times of year it's running.\nThe closest town to the Elk is Elko, which is a small town about 15 minutes west of Fernie on highway 3. The river essentially flows behind the large sawmill in town. Use this\nmap\nto get your bearings - the\ndirections on Paddling Maps\nare also good. The put in is located either in Elko at a bridge over the flatwater above the diversion dam at the start of the run, or right at the dam. It's possible to finish the run off with a steep hike out of the canyon below the Leap of Faith waterfall, but it's easiest and more fun to just paddle down through the\nMiddle Elk\nto get a few more rapids in. There's still a hike out but it's not as steep.\nThe Upper Elk is runnable at low flow times of year (spring and fall seasons). There is an old BC Hydro run-of-river power facility that can partially dewater this section of river, but\nas of 2016\nit is out of service indefinitely. 20-25 cms on the Elk gauge is in the medium range. With the power project out of operation, it won't have an impact on the river flow.\nThe Upper contains about half a dozen pool drop style rapids and some class IV boogie. Just below the dam is a cool slide, which is shortly followed by the first class V rapid, a ledge called Horseshoe. A few smaller things lead to the biggest rapid on the section called Caveman (or rather un-originally, Triple Drop). Here, two ledges lead in to a powerful river wide hole where some of the outflow feeds into a cave eddy. There is a hard portage down river left, with a permanent chain ladder installed to help with some down climbing. This rapid appears to have changed and gotten easier sometime before the 2020 season.\u00a0 Almost directly below Caveman is a portage around a dangerous/unrunnable rapid that's worth scouting before putting on if you've never done the run before, and then you're at Leap of Faith and the start of the middle section. Enjoy the freefall!\nHorseshoe drop.\nCaveman, the biggest rapid of the Upper Elk.  A few different lines all lead to a river wide hole with a cave on the side.\nClassic free fall on Leap of Faith, the end of the upper/start of the middle.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Be aware that when this creek is in, the Chilliwack Canyon is probably going to be high enough to be continuous Class IV whitewater.\nLuckily doing this run after a large storm most of the river was clear of wood, but you can inspect most of the run as you drive up. \u00a0 There is only one larger rapid which isn't visible from the road but you can scout it easily.\nDon't expect wonders from this creek, you need quite high flows in the Chilliwack to even give you enough water to consider this 'in'. \u00a0 I would have liked another 6inches or so water in the run to clean it up and make some of the bigger stuff nicer! The Chilliwack was running at 1.5m after about 30mm of rain overnight that also left a very visible snow-line, but it also had stopped raining for a few hours. Typically it'll be in when the Chilliwack has climbed quickly due to rain, but can also be in on snowmelt alone.\nTo get there drive to the\nChiliwack Canyon\ntake-out at Slesse Creek, that is the normal take-out of this run including the Class IV run.\u00a0 Continue to the canyon put-on, cross over the Chilliwack, turn left down Bench Forest Service Road.\u00a0 Drive until you go passed the main Chilliwack and see a smaller creek on your left.\u00a0 Take a look as you drive up and stop at the bridge and have a look at the gauge rock.\u00a0 If water is just going over this rock then it's on the good side of low, but has been paddled/rock-bashed lower. Make your own assessment, if you like the look of this section then you'll probably enjoy the rest of the run too.\u00a0 If you don't like the look of it, turn around and go to the regular Chilliwack Canyon put-on instead.\nThe gauge rock, the middle of the big rocks.\nDrive up Foley Creek FSR (4wd recommended) on river right as far as you like, go passed the next bridge, keep watching out for wood, for a full run keep driving until you get to Airplane Creek FSR (A steep turn-off sign-posted).\u00a0 Park at the turn-off, then walk over the bridge, bush-whack through to the very end of Airplane Creek where it meets Foley and put-on there.\nAn alternative put-on is further up Foley Creek (walking), there is probably 100m of Class IV- to run but it depends on wood. \u00a0 Up-stream of this there is some Class IV/V similar style to Tamihi Creek which has been paddled, starting somewhere near Foley Lake.\u00a0 Take a look carefully, but there was a lot of wood when we took a look and it has a few steep sections.\nA slightly steep section above the 2nd bridge\nAn almost river-wide log that was hard to see from river level\nEnjoy mostly read-and-run shallow boulder gardens, a slightly steeper rapid near the next bridge and one horizon-line small 3ft drop which can be run in the middle but worth inspecting for wood first.\nBoogie below the bridge starting to steepen up.\nAs you get to the Bench Road Bridge the gauge rock is the best boof on the river, and then below the river steepens and becomes quite fun until you end up ducking some bushes to emerge into the Chilliwack Canyon.\nBring old boats/paddles for this one, you will certainly hit a few rocks!\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

We have paddled between 700-1,300 cms.\nScenery\n: Come to descend into the guts of the Fraser Canyon and relive the gold rush times or come to celebrate the largest free running river on North America\u2019s Pacific coast. In early fall you can watch the salmon migrate and later see brilliantly yellow Maple trees along the exposed low water shoreline. Average June/July levels are 7,000 cms (peaking at 14,000 cms). Even with low fall levels, this will likely be one of the largest rivers you ever paddle.\nLength of Run\n: 20 km.\nLength of Shuttle (one way)\n: 20.2 km.\nSpecial Considerations\n: Note that this run is only paddled when the Fraser is at a very low level. Be ready for big powerful water. If you go in winter not much sunshine reaches the bottom of the canyon, so dress warmly. Watch for trains when you cross the tracks \u2013 both lines are pretty busy. The road is high above the river and accessible only in a few spots.\nDirections\n: From Vancouver take Hwy 1 East to Hope and continue on Hwy 1 along the Fraser for another 24 km to the city of Yale. In Yale take the second street on the right (Albert Street). Drive to a T intersection where you will find a pull-out (N49 33.690 W121 25.849). A trail leads to the river behind the \u2018Barnard\u2019s Express\u2019 sign. To the put-in continue north on Hwy 1 for 20.2 km. After crossing the Fraser River look for the gravel road on the left about 50 meters past the entrance to Alexandra Bridge Provincial Park. Follow this road for 400 meters to a rock barrier and park (N49 42.524 W121 24.726). After crossing the railroad tracks look for a minor trail on the outside of the first switchback to the right. This will get you down to the river. If you continue on the main trail you will reach Alexandra Bridge in about 100 meters.\nAn intermediate access point is about 12 km past Yale. Look for a pull-out on the river side 650 meters north of the end of Sailor Bar Tunnel (N49 38.578 W121 24.567). At the south end of the pull-out is a gravel road which heads down to the railroad tracks. Walk north along the tracks to a steep gravel slope (about 300 m from the Hwy). Cross the tracks (N49 38.726 W121 24.492) and locate a trail that leads in a southward descending traverse to the river (N49 38.694 W121 24.454).\nDescription\n: Please note that this description applies to low flows around 700-1300 cms. The average volume in summer is 10 times higher when river features will be considerably different. At low fall volumes 98% of this run is a fast and flat float. Only a couple of times the Fraser flexes its muscles. About 5 km from the put-in Spuzzum Creek joins from the right. 2.5 km below this confluence is the intermediate access point (N49 38.694 W121 24.454). If you want to take out here, make sure you first walk down from the road \u2013 the trail is overgrown and difficult to spot from the river. After a couple of bends you will see a house rock. We paddled the wave train in the left channel, a good class III wake-up after the initial float. Below this, the river winds its way through a narrow canyon with some swirls and boils but no rapids. At the end of the next big pool (more of a lake) is an island with characteristic shape: \u201cSaddle Rock\u201d. Again, we took the left channel which is flat until just above the end of the island. There the water drops significantly and forms impressive exploding waves, whirlpools and some holes. Scout from the left shore and pick your line. As long as you stay on line this drop is not technical (unless you find rolling in huge crashing waves and whirlpools technical), but pour-overs and holes near the shores warrant a class IV- rating. After this powerful drop there isn\u2019t much else except flat water all the way to Yale.\nCamping and Food\n: There are official campgrounds and restaurants in Yale and Hope. For the really hungry paddler \u2013 try the Home Restaurant in Hope (it\u2019s on Old Hope-Princeton Way parallel to Hwy 3/5).\nNon-paddling Activities\n: Yale has a rich gold rush history. You can check out the museum and even try gold panning. Yale was founded as a Hudson's Bay fort in 1848 and soon developed into an important stopping point for travelers on the Fraser River. In 1858 gold was found just 2 miles south of Yale on the Fraser River. This discovery caused an invasion of prospectors and miners from all over the world, making Yale, with over 20,000 residents, temporarily the largest town on the West coast. The put-in is at the historic Alexandra Bridge. The first suspension bridge was built here for the prospectors and miners of the Cariboo Gold Rush in 1862. The Alexandra Bridge you see is a replacement of the second bridge which was washed out in a flood in 1887.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

You either run it or you don't.\nTime\n1 hour.\nWhen to Go\nCan be hard to catch because of a tight flow window - after rain or snowmelt all year.\nThere's not a lot to say about Furry Creek - it's a park-n-huck along the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Squamish made up of an aesthetically pleasing, quite stout series of four waterfalls. Furry Creek, aside from the creek, is also a small community and golf course and the waterfalls are smack in the middle of the whole thing. As such it's imperative that if you decide to run these drops you need to keep a very low profile. I can't stress that enough -\ndon't jeopardize access by being stupid\n- this is a great resource and it would be a terrible loss were the local community to actively dissuade boaters from running the creek.\nThere is logging road access to the creek a few hundred meters above the golf course - it's possible to walk down the creek to get to the falls. There is plenty of thick forest between the falls and the fairways from which to scout and take pictures - if you do this you'll be largely out of sight. The top, farthest end of the golf course parking lot is immediately adjacent to the forest and the Crack Falls.\nThe creek itself is very level dependent with a small window between being too low and too high - you can only tell the level by looking. As such it's hard to find good flows. There is a hydro project on this river, but both the intake and the powerhouse are above the falls. Expect 4 waterfalls in the 15-30 foot range stacked right on top of one another, each with it's own issues. After the last drop the river almost immediately drops into a terrible sieve with only one small eddy before it. Set strong safety.\nIf you want a challenge this is the place to go. Have fun, be smart about accessing the creek and above all be safe.\nDrop #2 - dropping into the heart of the short gorge.\nThe Crack.\nDropping out of the Crack pool and over the last falls.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Walking the canyons due to high water would be a major undertaking.\nTime\n5 days minimum.  6 or 7 are recommended in case of high water portaging or for enjoying the area.\nWhen to Go\nLate August, early September.  Getting the correct level is one of the most challenging logistics to this trip.\nContributed by Ali Marshall\nThe\nKitlope Heritage Conservancy\nis a BC Park that encompasses the largest tract of untouched coastal temperate rainforest in the world. It is a truly pristine wilderness, home to grizzlies, wolves and all 5 species of salmon that spawn annually in its waters. The Gamsby River is one of the main tributaries of the Kitlope River, cutting through the Coast Mountains until it reaches the rainforests of the Pacific.\nThis fly in trip consists of three days of incredible white water. Flowing emerald green through polished granite canyons, it is similar in style to the\nAshlu Mine\nsection in Squamish. If the water level is correct then there are no major portages, only a few that can be done at river level. After the white water you can sit back, relax and float for two days, soaking up some of the best scenery in BC. Don't forget to stop at the\nShearwater Hot Springs\non your boat ride back to Kitimat.\nThe\nfirst attempt on this river\nwas made by an American team in 2001. They were thwarted by high water and flew out from Ear Lake after a portage fest.\nBook a float plane with\nLake District Air\nin Burns Lake. Fly into Coles Lake (just outside the park boundary). An easy 4 km hike over a mountain saddle will see you into the Kitlope/Gamsby watershed. You will arrive at the source of the river, 1 km from the glacier that gives birth to it. There is only just enough water to paddle from here. Beware of wood. After two hours of manky paddling the river bed turns to granite bed rock and you pass through a couple of scenic mini box canyons. Shortly after a powerful tributary enters from river right which marks the start of the good white water. You are rewarded by 10 km of beautiful class 3-4 read and run before the first camp.\nDay 2 starts off with more of the same. There are several kilometres of class 3-4 read and run with a couple of class 5 rapids to keep you on your toes. The canyon walls start to grow and you come to a spectacular polished box canyon. The first rapid is a portage. After walking it at river level you are treated to 3 km of class 4-5 rapids. Some scenic class 2 takes you to camp 2, a large beach and stream on river right. This is at the start of the lower canyon.\nThe lower canyon is a 7 km ultra classic class 4/5 section. Every rapid is good to go. Nearly everything can be scouted at river level. At high water this section could be very challenging and to portage the whole thing would be a 2 day suffer fest.\nA spectacular waterfall marks the end of the white water. 40 km of flat water will have you arriving at the ocean. This is a very special part of the world and we spent 4 days enjoying the zone. If a team had good water levels and were moving fast, the trip could be done in 4 days. I would recommend a minimum of 5. We took 7. 3 days of rapids, 4 days to enjoy the area.\nArrange a boat pick up from Kitimat. On your 140km boat ride back through the beautiful Gardner Canal, stop at the Shearwater Hot springs for a good soak.\nThis river trip is a truly special experience. You are in a wild and remote area. Be bear aware. Please be respectful to the land, this is a unique landscape that is sacred to the Haisla nation. Hopefully with this river becoming a new classic, kayakers can use their voice to help continue the protection of this coastal paradise.\nMeadows on the 4 km hike from Coles Lake to the Gamsby.\nGoing over the small saddle between Coles Lake and the Gamsby.\nThe beginning of the whitewater.\nA classic day 1 rapid.\nCamp 1.\nThe first major canyon.\nCamp 2.\nClassic whitewater of the lower canyon.\nClassic whitewater of the lower canyon.\nClassic whitewater of the lower canyon.\nThe waterfall at the end of the whiteawater.\nThe entrance to Kitlope Lake.\nBeautiful camping on the lower river.\nThere are hundreds of waterfalls flowing into the lower river.\nFantastic coastline when you reach the ocean.\nShearwater Hot Springs.\nGamsby Trivia\nThe group of Ali Marshall, Luke Borserio and Louis Bissonnette completed the first full descent of the Gamsby in August 2017.\nA team previously attempted the Gamsby in the early 2000's, bailing at Ear Lake due to high water.

The whitewater is good but not classic.\nClass\nIV-V\nScouting / Portaging\nThere are no canyons and everything can be scouted and portaged.  There's a fair bit of walking if you don't paddle the class V parts.\nTime\n3 days.\nWhen to Go\nLate August.\nContributed by Ali Marshall\nThe Gilttoyees is a classic North Coast kayaking adventure. The whitewater is good, not amazing, but the combination of the coastal wilderness, the scenery and the whitewater makes for an incredible trip. This watershed is located in the\nFoch-Gilttoyees Provincial Park\n. You won't see any sign of human development until you reach the cabin at the pickup point on the ocean. This river valley is a historic trade route for First Nations between the Douglas Channel and the Skeena River. It is called as a 'grease trail', from the oolichan fish oil that was transported along it. This is grizzly bear and salmon habitat so please be bear aware.\nLogistics are significant. Organise a helicopter in Terrace. They have to have a permit to be able to land in any of the BC parks. In BC you cannot fly passengers and a sling full of kayaks at the same time. Have someone take your kayaks and gear to a clearing near the Exchamsiks River (40 minutes west of Terrace) and have the kayaks pre-loaded in a net ready for pick up. Fly the passengers to the Gilttoyees from Terrace, and then have the pilot fly down the Gitnadoiks River to the Exchamsiks and have him pick up the net full of gear to bring back to the put in. This is the fastest and most cost effective way to fly in. The flight is SPECTACULAR.\nYou are dropped off in a beautiful sub alpine valley. You paddle for an hour or so before the rapids in an area that is not dissimilar to Yosemite. There are only small stands of trees at this stage as nearly the entire valley is an avalanche path. The whitewater is steeper and bigger than it looks from the air. If you don't want to paddle class 5 then you will be walking most of the rapids. After a beautiful bedrock slide the river plunges over a 100 foot waterfall, which you portage on river left. Camp 1 is just around the corner and it is stunning.\nThe whitewater on the second day is much like the first with a mix of rapids, slides and falls. When the salmon start to appear you know the whitewater is coming to an end. The forest at this stage is lush and the large cedar and spruce trees appear. After an hour or so of beautiful flatwater you reach the tidal estuary. A couple of kilometers past the estuary, on paddlers left is an open cabin that you can stay in. There are often fishermen there. This is the perfect place to get picked up by your boat. A 50 km ride will have you back in Kitimat.\nDon't forget to stop at the 'park n huck' Jesse Falls on your way back. It is a falls that drops into the ocean just east of the Gilttoyees inlet.\nA story: As we were about to land the helicopter, at the beginning of our trip, one of our team saw that the river was loaded with salmon. We were pretty sure salmon couldn't swim up 100ft waterfalls and after checking the GPS we found that we were at the last rapid on the run. We nearly completed the shortest and most expensive fly in trip ever.\nGetting dropped off by the heli.\nIncredible scenery on the flight from Terrace.\nIncredible scenery on the flight from Terrace.

The aptly named Flood Run is as you would expect; a section that is best run when the Gordon (and everything else in the area) is running at high water. While not of the same quality as the lower sections of this river, the Flood Run is a great alternative if there really is nothing else to paddle because the water is too high, and you're in the area.\nUnfortunately there is no online gauge for the Gordon River. Levels can be approximated from the Harris Creek gauge, otherwise you just have to go look. If everything in the area is visibly too high, this run is good to go. Otherwise, the Harris Creek gauge should probably be reading at least 10 cms before starting to think about this run. Major flood events (floating wood in river etc.) aside, this run likely doesn't get too high as most of the rapids are easy to portage. It is possible to combine the Flood Run down through a high water\nUpper Gordon\nwhen conditions are right.\nA Backroads Mapbook will be your friend in finding your way around the Gordon. The river is accessed by driving down the Gordon River logging road that connects Mesachie Lake with Port Renfrew. It is usually quicker to get to the Gordon through Lake Cowichan, even if coming from Victoria. The take out is at the well known put in for the uber classic Upper Gordon. The put in is at the next bridge about 8 km upstream. The road closely follows the river for the length of the run, and many of the rapids are visible from the shuttle.\nOnce on the water, the majority of this run is self explanatory. The run consists of relatively continuous moderate boogie peppered with several bigger rapids. Everything is visible from above, and you will probably have stopped and looked at the biggest rapids from the road. The hardest rapids are easy to walk, the road is always close and everything is scoutable. Keep in mind that even though this run is accessible at high flows, things can chug along very quickly and weaker groups should proceed with caution when it is pumping.\nView\nGordon Flood\nin a larger map\nWalking to the river at the put in on a high water day.\nFloating around the corner from the put in.\nPortaging around the biggest rapid of the run - sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.\nFlood Run boogie.\nBad things happening to good people.

The middle section of the river, usually just referred to as the Middle Gordon, is certainly the most challenging stretch of the whole river, and it is perhaps one of the most high quality class IV-V runs in the whole southern island zone. Typified by big granite ledges and clear, vibrant green water the Middle Gordon is one of the runs that makes Vancouver Island such a good kayak destination.\nThe Gordon is a rain-fed river that runs in the fall and winter, when Vancouver Island is continuously pounded by rainstorms. Like all other runs in the area, it tends to flash up quickly after rain, but unlike other runs in the area the Middle Gordon often holds water for a week after a good sized rain event. Generally speaking the Gordon is a lower-water run and while the true level is visual only, look for 2-6 cms on the\nHarris Creek\ngauge as a rough guide for whether it is running. Higher is possible, but not recommended for your first time. The Gordon usually doesn't have a snowmelt season.\nUse a Backroads Mapbook to find your way around the Middle Gordon. The river is paralleled by the Gordon River FSR that is accessible from both Port Renfrew and Lake Cowichan. It's usually quicker to come in from Lake Cowichan. The Middle Gordon starts at the confluence with Loup Creek, where you can access the river about 100 meters downstream from the bridge. Unless the water is very low, it's recommended to put in at the\nUpper Gordon\n. The take out is at Bugaboo Creek. There is a trail cut on the river left side of Bugaboo Creek that leads to the Gordon, and is marked from the water by Bugaboo Creek pouring into the Gordon over a 30 foot waterfall and by a large fixed rope on the shore to help paddlers climb out of the canyon. It's almost as fast to quickly paddle the Lower Gordon (class III+), which has easy take out access and makes for a nice long paddle trip.\nOn the water, the Middle Gordon presents itself as pool-drop whitewater with reasonable scouting opportunities and almost always the possibility of portaging. The first rapid is a waterfall run down the middle with a tricky entrance and serious consequences on both sides. Good boulder rapids interspersed with big bedrock ledges follow. One rapid called Minefield is not really walkable, but it is not the hardest rapid on the run. It is unusual for the run to be completed with no portages - amongst the classic ledges are some sieves and one monster rapid. Enjoy visiting the Middle Gordon, it's a true Vancouver Island classic.\nThe entrance drop to the Middle Gordon.  The water really is as green as it looks.\nScouting a random drop.\nMinefield.

Fun, clean rapids and clear water.\nClass\nIV at medium water.\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to moderate.\nTime\n2 hours.\nWhen to Go\nAfter rain, all year.  Best chance in the fall and winter.\nGauge\n1.25cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:20)\n!\nThe Gordon River is often the first river that comes to mind when people speak of kayaking on Vancouver Island. It's one of the bread and butter runs of the southern kayak zone that has multiple sections which tolerate a variety of water levels, and it remains runnable for a long window after it rains. The upper run is a great bedrock pool-drop section suitable for intermediates at lower flows that remains of interest to stronger boaters because of the high quality rapids, as a quick warm up for the class IV-V\nMiddle Gordon\n, or at really high water simply because it is really fun when it's high.\nThe Gordon doesn't have a gauge, but levels can be approximated from the Harris Creek gauge. A level of 4-6 cms on that gauge usually means it will be in the medium range, and 10+ cms will probably be high water. Otherwise, levels are visual - prior experience helps in knowing exact flow. The Gordon holds water for a long time, long after other runs in the area are low or have dried up. If there's been a decent rain within 4 or 5 days it will probably have water. The Upper Gordon also tolerates high water very well, and the high water range is quite wide.\nSouthern Vancouver Island tends to be a rats nest of new and old logging roads so using a Backroads Mapbook to find your way around is highly recommended. Fortunately the Gordon is paralleled by one of the main roads that heads north from Port Renfrew to Lake Cowichan so as long as you can find this main road there should be little problem finding the access points for the river.\nThe put in for the Upper Gordon is at the third bridge (counting from the ocean) over the river, found down a short spur off the main Gordon River road. There is large rock downstream of the bridge that has a metal memorial bolted to it that serves as an obvious marker to tell if it's the right bridge. The take out is found about 100 meters below Loup Creek (a major river right tributary) where a short trail comes up from the water.\nThe Upper Gordon starts out flat. This doesn't last for long and quickly you'll come upon some nice warm up rapids. You'll eventually reach the main bedrock section where things will maintain a pool-drop character with scouting and portaging that generally remains straightforward. The crux of the run comes as a series of three rapids in quick succession called Triple Drop. It is nestled down in a small canyon and can be portaged through the forest on the left.\nBelow here things being to ease off. There is one more rapid of note remaining called Terminator. This rapid has a deceptive lead in to a sticky recirculating hole at the bottom, and an easy portage on the left. The take out is after Loup Creek enters from the right just above a hard left bend in the river. A short trail goes up to the road at the bend. If you reach a stout 15 foot waterfall you've gone too far.\nA note on high water: Proper high flow is when water is near or flowing over the top of the large rock downstream of the put in bridge. The lines largely remain the same, but it turns from pool drop into a bit of a gushing torrent with a few huge holes.\nCalm waters at the put in of the Upper Gordon.\nClose up of the large rock downstream of the bridge, a potential gauge.  This is a normal medium flow.  It's completely reasonable to run high water laps when there's water going over the top of this rock.\nOne of the first rapids of note.  Fun river running.\nA good sliding rapid.\nTriple Drop on a dark, very rainy day.\nTriple Drop again, with a little better weather.  Notice the slight water color difference?\nThe Terminator.

      "full_text": "BCWhitewater\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nAbout\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact\nBecome a member\nGrand Canyon of the Stikine\nWhat It's Like\nThe most famous class 5 multiday in North America. Big volume paddling in a spectacular, committing canyon.\nClass\nV\nScouting / Portaging\nScouting OK.  There are several large must run rapids.\nTime\nTraditionally 3 days, can be done in 1 (or why not 2 laps in one day?).\nWhen to Go\nAugust to September.  Snow pack and rain dependant.\nGauge\n218.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:40)\n!\nContributed by Ali Marshall and Ben Marr\nThe Stikine is born on the Spatsizi Plateau, in the interior of Northern BC. Sometimes called 'The Sacred Headwaters', this pristine wilderness is the source of the Northwest's three greatest salmon rivers: the Stikine, the Nass and the Skeena.\nThe Stikine flows for 610 km until it reaches the Pacific at Wrangle, Alaska. As the river plunges off the interior plateau it starts to cut its way through layers of sedimentary and volcanic rock forming 'The Grand Canyon'. The river drops 450 m over 70 km, through a canyon with walls 1000 ft tall.\nIn 1980, BC Hydro began a feasibility study to try and harness the potential energy of the Canyon. There was a proposal to build two mega dams, one at Site Z and one at the Tanzilla Slot. Pressure from environmental groups, local Tahltan First Nations and poor geological stability in the area saved the Canyon from being flooded.\nThe first descent was attempted in 1981, a team led by Rob Lesser. With helicopter support they managed to paddle around 60 % of the run. The first self-support kayak descent did not happen until 1990. The progression of kayaking has been no more obvious than in the Stikine canyon. In 2005 the LVM crew blew the kayaking world away with their 1 day descent. Until around 2009 the canyon had a fierce reputation. Only the world's best kayakers would dare paddle it, with only one or two crews a year making an attempt. In 2012 Ben Marr completed the first full descent, running the huge portage Site Z. Speed laps are now done, and in 2017 a crew paddled the entire section twice in one day. High water levels are also being pushed.\nThis progression in the sport takes nothing away from the Stikine experience. It is one of the greatest whitewater sections on earth - 70 km of committing big volume class 5 in a breathtaking canyon. This river is attainable for any solid class 5 kayaker with some big water experience, but the river demands respect. There are several high consequence rapids and some of the best paddlers in the world have had close calls. Come prepared and enjoy one of the wildest rides of your life.\nDirections\nDrive 20+ hours north from Vancouver, BC. The put in is at the large steel bridge over the Stikine on the Stewart Cassiar Highway (Hwy 37). You cannot miss the famous yellow sign. Run your shuttle and leave a vehicle 20 km before the town of Telegraph Creek. To get there, drive to the town of Dease Lake. Find the Telegraph Creek Rd and follow for 2 hrs. Drive carefully. There is a beautiful beach just after you drive over the Tahltan River, which is the take out. In the cliffs on the other side of the river is a basalt rock formation called 'The Old Crow' sacred to the Tahltan people. This is traditional territory so please be very respectful when you are there. After your descent you can drive another 20 km to the town and grab a pretty good burger.\nDescription\nDay 1\nAfter 10 km of flatwater the canyon walls grow quickly and you come to Entry Falls. There is an optional scout on river left from the top of the canyon. Wicked Wanda, Three Goats and Pass or Fail are next. All these rapids may be scouted and portaged. Up next is the large, must run rapid, Wasson's Hole. There is a sneak line on the right or you can run the classic but more exposed left to right move in front of the huge hole. You soon arrive at Site Z. There is an obvious flat terrace on river right where you can set up camp.\nDay 2\nDay two starts off with either a huge portage or a huge rapid at Site Z. Taking the high road on the portage is the faster but more dangerous route. Weaving your way through the house size boulders at river level is slower but safer. It is now not uncommon for teams to run the entire rapid, but more commonly just the lower half. The river has changed and the once notorious Hairy Ferry from the bottom of Site Z is now not such a big deal. On day 2 the river enters The Narrows, the tightest and deepest part of the canyon. There is a rapid called C#nt Hole, which sneaks up and catches out most new groups. Don't get complacent. Next is a must run and unscoutable drop called The Wall. Entering center left and heading to the middle works well at most flows. The canyon opens and the final rapid of the day is Garden of the Gods. A large beach appears on your left. Just above it is Wolf Den camp, a sheltered area under a large overhanging cliff.\nDay 3\nGarden of the Gods 2 is the first rapid of the day. It is a nice warm up boulder garden rapid that is different in character to the rest of the run. Rowdy Flatwater follows, a long section of tight and boily read and run. Next is The Wall 2, Scissors, and The Hole that ate Chicago. These are large rapids but they can be scouted and portaged at normal levels. The grand finale is V-Drive, a giant ramp into exploding waves and holes. This can be scouted but not portaged. The lower the water, the rowdier this rapid becomes. It's time to celebrate as you pass through the Tanzilla Slot, a 2 m wide slot that the Stikine is somehow squeezed through. There is just one more class 4 rapid downstream. After that relax, soak in the incredible geology and reflect upon your amazing experience. There is an hour or two of flat water to the take out.\nThis is a bare bones description of the Stikine canyon. There are many more rapids than are mentioned in this guide, but should give new teams enough beta for a successful descent.\nThe classic photo of the sign at the put in.

A great waterfall run with some boulder rapids and a lot of wood.\nClass\nV\nScouting / Portaging\nScouting is reasonable but portaging can be hard.  The biggest drop is not readily portaged.\nTime\n5-8 hours.\nWhen to Go\nAfter rain in the fall and winter.\nGauge\n2.19cms\u2191 (Oct 21 06:15)\n!\nGranite Creek is a small, unassuming drainage at the southern tip of Vancouver Island that holds a remarkable array of waterfalls along its length. The first clean drop is little more than ten or twenty paddle strokes from where you launch into the river, and it just keeps giving up the goods until you reach the best and final 20-to-40 footer combo just above the take out. The only downside to the run is the incredible amount of wood in the river - it's likely to always be an issue that changes after every high water event.\nGranite Creek runs when things are medium to high in the area. The online\nRenfrew Creek\ngauge is accurate and it corresponds to the stick gauge located at the put in. The flow tends to rise and fall quickly. Note that the put in gauge will read, for example, 0.70 when the online gauge reads 1.70. Referring to the gauge at the put in, 0.60 is absolute bare minimum and 0.80 is the medium sweet spot. Higher is possible.\nAccess to Granite is along the well maintained road network resulting from heavy logging on the Island. The take out is at the southern end of the Harris Main logging road near Port Renfrew. The Harris Main can be found just north of Port Renfrew or it can be accessed from outside the town of Lake Cowichan. The take out is where the creek goes under the Harris Main. Take note, it is signed Renfrew Creek at the bridge - the creek is labeled \"Granite (Renfrew) Creek\" in the 5th ed. Backroads Mapbook. The put in is up the river left logging road. After the 6 km marker a spur will break to the left, which quickly brings you to the put in bridge and the visual gauge.\nThe Granite comes out swinging. From the bridge you can see an obvious horizon line - just a taste of what's downstream. It's a small creek here, but don't worry too much - it picks up volume as you go down river. Launch from under the bridge, run the lead in and then boof 10 feet off the first of many clean drops. Apparently there are 24 ledges and waterfalls on this stretch (I didn't count). What follows are more clean drops interspersed with small to medium sized bedrock and boulder rapids. You will need to scout carefully for wood and portage where necessary. The river doesn't canyonize until the very end and everything can be portaged with some effort. It is pointless to describe where the wood lives as it changes after every flood. Everything is runnable if it's not clogged, though you will have to be very lucky to have the whole run clean.\nAbout 2/3 of the way down a significant tributary enters from the right. One of the bigger waterfalls is below here, and below that a huge landside has dropped in from the right creating an enormous log jam that is currently a mandatory portage. After some more rapids including one of the bigger non-waterfall drops you will get to the best part of the run - a 20-to-40 footer combo.\nThese falls are the entrance to the only vertical walled canyon on the run. If you run the first you have to run the second - there is a huge pool between the two that gives enough space to collect people and take a breather. After dropping into the pool below the big waterfall you're faced with several hundred meters of steep, sievey, mostly runnable boulder piles that, despite the big walls, can be dealt with at river level. All too soon you'll be paddling the class II run out down to the bridge where cold beers and your shuttle are waiting, topping off a great river.\nFinally, here are some photos of the run. They will certainly fuel your fire to go run Granite Creek. The photos are in downstream order.\nThe scene from the put in bridge.\nOne of the early drops - a narrow entrance into a late boof.\nMatt scales a slimy wall to catch a glimpse of a 30 footer blocked with wood.\nA wood problem.\nDropping a clean 15.\nThe same clean 15.\ngranite7.jpg\n512 KB\ngranite8.jpg\n255 KB\nA fast lead in to a fun boof.\ngranite10.jpg\n270 KB\nThe first of the final two.\nThe last waterfall.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Portaging at river level often not possible.\nTime\nUp to 8 hours for a first run. Probably one hour to bomb it.\nWhen to Go\nLate Spring - May-June\nGauge\n3.19cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:20)\n!\nNOTE: This description was written in 2021, but before major floods impacted the region later that year.\nGranite Creek, another name a kayaker can't ignore. Indeed, this creek has four decent low volume class IV+ canyons and a small waterfall before joining the Tulameen River near Coalmont. However, in the second canyon\nthere is an extremely dangerous mining adit where almost the whole river goes underground, and this whole section cannot be recommended.\nIt would still be worth it to put in below the adit and run the final two canyons, if you can find a way to bushwhack down to the creek. The character of the rapids and the commitment factor are somewhat comparable to Norrish Creek in the Fraser Valley. While you're in the area, the nearby Upper Tulameen also has some exploratory class III-V creeking, and in the same region are the classic class IV runs on the Similkameen and Ashnola Rivers.\nFlows\nThe Tulameen watershed is on the dry side of the Coast Mountains, and the snowmelt season usually only lasts a few weeks in May and June. Granite Creek does not have a gauge, but at the takeout bridge the creek should look like you can get down without bumping rocks too much, but it shouldn't look high. The canyons upstream narrows to 3m width in places. There should be a decent correlation with the Tulameen gauges: a medium-low flow on Granite Creek equated to 20cms on Tulameen below Vuich Creek and 60cms on Tulameen at Princeton.\nShuttle\nThe takeout is at Granite Creek Recreation Site just outside of Coalmont, which can be reached by a paved roads branching off Highway 3 in Princeton. Total driving time from Vancouver is 4 hours. The Tulameen zone can also be accessed from the Coquihalla Highway via forest service roads. To get to the put in, drive up Granite/Blakeburn FSR on river left for ~6km to the ghost town of Blakeburn. Here, bear left onto Arrastra FSR which switchbacks down to Blakeburn Creek. The safest put in is at the confluence of Blakeburn Creek (too small to paddle) and Granite Creek, but you will have to find a way to bushwhack down to that point. Or, for the most whitewater, keep driving upstream to a a pullout on the left 300m past a bridge over Newton Creek, where a trail leads down to near the confluence of Newton Creek and Granite Creek. This put in is below the logjams and at the start of the whitewater, but above the a dangerous mining tunnel. A final option is to put in where the Arrastra FSR drops down to creek level, but by putting in here you will have to deal with a few sketchy logjams as well as the dangerous tunnel.\nOn the water\nFrom this uppermost put in, where Granite Creek is roadside, the paddle starts as wood choked class III-IV down to Newton Creek. From Newton Creek down to the Tulameen, Granite Creek alternates between continuous class III+, tight class IV boulder drops, and four narrow canyons. Boat scouting is often possible, but you will frequently be catching one-boat eddies or grabbing willow branches to scramble up and scout around corners and down into canyons. The canyons come up quickly. Wood portages are likely, but the creek is not a wood-choked disaster. The first canyon is a committing narrows that may be difficult to portage, but contains only one easy ledge. The second canyon is extremely dangerous, as most of the river goes underground in an abandoned placer mining drain tunnel, and it is not easy to spot this feature or to stop above it. Putting on above this feature is not recommended. If you do, it is possible to get out well above the feature, and portage on river left up and over a ridge down into Blakeburn Creek, but this will probably take over an hour. Portaging at river level may be possible, but there is significant exposure to the drain. Below the adit, and a mostly dewatered section, the second canyon appears to consist of a boxed in series of ledge holes, although this was not paddled. At some point in the second canyon the water re-enters Granite Creek through the exit of the mine tunnel. This whole mess can be avoided by putting on at the confluence of Blakeburn Creek and Granite Creek. Below Blakeburn Creek, the third canyon is quite narrow and has a series of runnable ledge holes. If necessary, it can be portaged along a narrow ledge on river right about 20m above river level. The fourth canyon contains a boulder sluice into an excellent 4m waterfall into a huge pool. Portaging this one (on the right) is probably sketchier than just running it. From here the difficulty eases up to the takeout, and it's easiest just to take out at the rec site on the Tulameen River.\nAn old cabin near the confluence of Newton and Granite Creeks.\nA sketchy logjam just above the confluence with Newton Creek, just below the cabin in the previous picture.\nClass IV boogie early in the run.\nThe first canyon is pretty straightforward.\nExtremely dangerous feature at the start of the second canyon. Almost the entire river goes underground into an abandoned mining drain tunnel. In this photo, the river flows in from the bottom right. The riverbed continues downstream into the distance, but with only ~10% of the flow. ~90% of the flow goes into the whirlpool on the left and goes underground. This feature is difficult to spot from above, difficult to stop above, dangerous to portage, and it is not recommended to paddle this section.\nLooking back up the exit of the second canyon from the confluence of Blakeburn Creek. Putting in at the Blakeburn confluence is below the dangerous adit, but will be quite a bushwhack to get in.\nLead in to the third canyon.\nRunout of the third canyon.\nLead in to the fourth canyon.\nExcellent 4m waterfall in the fourth canyon.\nA medium low flow near the takeout.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Often tragically infested with wood.\nClass\nIV-V\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to moderate.\nTime\n3-5 hours.  It's hard to bomb because of the constant threat of wood.\nWhen to Go\nMid-season snowmelt - June through early August.\nThe Green River in Whistler is best known as the river where the local raft guides spend most of their time pushing clients down a section of whitewater that's a mediocre raft run at best. What's passed over by almost everyone is the section from the raft take out through to the Soo/Green confluence. It's a lengthy section of river (unusual for the area) that has great class IV-V river running for miles, but unfortunately it is usually full of wood mandating multiple portages. The threat of wood and a longer shuttle than the other local runs conspire to keep this one out of the list of Whistler classics, but it's worth a trip if only to paddle different whitewater and to have an adventure not far from Whistler village.\nThere is no online gauge for the Green. It should be runnable when things in the Whistler area are running medium, in the early to mid-summer season. The Green dries up at the end of the snowmelt season, so if the rafts are no longer out on the Green it is definitely too low. It should handle a range of flows well, but high flows can be dangerous because of all the wood dodging. It is difficult to gauge what the rapids will look like - there are no obvious access points to the whitewater sections and we don't have a recommendation for a visual gauge at the put in or take out.\nEven though the river is close to Whistler is has a lengthy shuttle. There are several places to put in, the obvious ones being at either the bridge over the river that accesses the Wedgemount Lake trailhead, or the bridge in the community of Wedge Woods, where the rafts take out. The river flows towards Pemberton. The take out is at another bridge over the river about 10 km downstream, which you can find by taking the forest service road that leaves highway 99 near the dirt bike track next to the\nSoo\ntake out. Following to road for several km past the motor sports park and up the Green valley eventually brings you to the bridge, and ample parking.\nThe first rapid on the Green is right below the Wedge Woods bridge, where Wedgemount Creek comes in. After a short mellow section, the river picks up to good class IV-IV+ river running where you have to be constantly vigilant for wood. For most of this upper stretch there is emergency access on river left using the railroad. After the river opens up and runs under some large power lines, you will reach a class V rapid in a short canyon that can be scouted/portaged on the right. This is the last reasonable place to exit the river, and in the future someone might find access here (through a quarry next to the river) that would avoid the wood-filled lower half of the run. This lower half contains 2 large class V rapids that are permanently blocked with wood (parts of each rapid are still runnable), and some boogie. After the 2nd wood filled rapid, there is one more fun IV+ rapid before you reach the take out bridge.\nThe first twisting rapid of the Middle Green, just below the put in.\nA typical rapid on the upper stretch of river.\nBoogie on the lower stretch of the Middle Green.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

July is possible in big snow years.\nGun Creek is a river with a unique character for the South Coast area of BC. Flowing out of the South Chilcotin mountains, it's a tributary of the extensive Bridge River system near the town of Gold Bridge, which is really in the middle of nowhere. This area is renowned for epic hiking and mountain biking in the\nSouth Chilcotin Mountain Park\n, a zone known for endless alpine trails and crazy scenery. The river itself is neat too, with the main character being super continuous moderate difficulty whitewater from start to finish. Despite the III-IV rating, you still need to be careful as there really aren't many good eddies, and stopping above wood in the river, which there is a fair bit of, is a concern. This is a great section to combine with the Bridge River, if BC Hydro is releasing water from the Terzaghi Dam.\nThis river is far out there, on the fringe of where roads reach in the South Coast area. Gun Creek flows into Carpenter Lake, one of the reservoirs for the\nBridge River hydro project\n. The nearest town is Gold Bridge (it's very small), which is 2-3 hours from Pemberton either by taking the Hurley or by going the long way out through Lillooet. The take out is where the river ends at the lake. There is a bridge over the river and a free\nBC Hydro campsite there\n. The put in is upstream on river right along the Slim Creek FSR. It's a mess of roads up there, but if you keep on the main dirt road you'll eventually reach the Jewel Creek trailhead for the South Chilcotin Park, which is the easiest put in. There are options to start upstream and downstream. Gun Creek quickly splits into Gun, Leckie and Slim Creeks upstream - Slim Creek is the main stem that follows the road. It's harder and needs lower water than when you would be there to run the section of Gun Creek described here.\nGun Creek runs during the high water snowmelt season. There's no online gauge, unfortunately. Booming, maximum snowmelt flow might not be appropriate, but otherwise June should be the best window. July is possible in years with lots of snow. Don't bother with the long drive if you think the flow will be low. If you do get skunked by low water, the\nHurley\nmight be possible.\nThere's not much to say about the river itself other than it's one rapid from start to finish. The character is very continuous, splashy class III-IV with few good eddies and a fair bit of wood that requires vigilance. There aren't many defined moves, but there are a few sections that are spicier that the rest of the river. You'll get the best overview of this river by watching this\nGoPro video of the run\n.\nGun Creek sign at the take out bridge.  You can't miss it.\nGearing up at the Jewel Creek Trailhead.  The put in is also the start of some fantastic multiday hiking in the South Chilcotin Mountains Provincial Park.\nFirst whitewater.

Nice class IV-V boating.\nClass\nIV-V\nScouting / Portaging\nModerate.\nTime\n2-3 hours your first time.\nWhen to Go\nRain fed, fall through spring.\nGauge\n1.25cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:20)\n!\nHarris Creek is one of the multitudes of rivers found in the Port Renfrew zone on southern Vancouver Island. Like many runs in the area it is quite short, however if you've never run it before it will take a few hours to sort out all the rapids packed into the canyon. Expect to encounter good quality, steep boulder pile rapids that generally build in difficulty as the run progresses. It is a great river to run multiple laps of, or to combine with something else nearby like the\nGordon\n.\nThe Harris has an accurate online gauge. Low water is about 3 cms. A good medium level, appropriate for a first visit, is around 4.5-5 cms. It can certainly be paddled at high water, but we can only recommend running the creek over 7-8 cms if you have previous experience on the run. This run beefs up quickly at high levels. The rapids you can see from the take out bridge and along the shuttle road are a good indication of the character of the run.\nAccess to this river is along paved roads that are kept plowed in the winter when the region gets snow. Other roads in the area are often left to melt out naturally. A backroads map book is a useful tool as always. To reach the Harris it is usually quickest to approach from Lake Cowichan, even when coming from Victoria. Follow the main road from Lake Cowichan to Port Renfrew. This road parallels the Harris from its headwaters all the way to the ocean. The take out is at a bridge over the river on the Port Renfrew end of the road. The canyon upstream is obvious. The put in is 2 or 3 km upstream at the first point the river is right next to the road.\nAt the put in the river is class II. There are several short class IV rapids that lead to the first drop that will require a proper scout. Once you reach this point the rapids will typically come in quick succession with no real pools between them. There are decent amounts of slack water and/or class II to regroup after the big ones. The end of the run approaches after you paddle a long bedrock hallway rapid called Stairway to Heaven. This rapid has a sticky hole and a large pool at the bottom. The next rapid (which is the furthest upstream rapid you can see from the bridge) is the crux of the run and it deserves a good look. If it's not to your liking you can walk to the take out on the left, or you can figure out a way to portage the bits you don't like. Once below the corner rapid enjoy the last few drops and take out on river right just below the bridge.\nHector firing up one of the first notable rapids on the Harris.\nA classic boof.\nThis is what many of the downstream views look like on the Harris.\nA view from the road along the river.\nA long rapid called Stairway to Heaven.\nThe final sequence of the Harris canyon.\nAmazing green water typical on the Island.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

A couple of adventurous box canyons will bring you down to the takeout at the baseball diamond. While you're in the area, make sure to check out some of the 5 sections on the Gold River, as well as the other local creeks: Ucona, Pamela, Quatchka, and Upana. Look for these runs and others to be described in an upcoming guidebook produced by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nAs with many of the creeks in Gold River, a good starting point is 100cms on GOLD RIVER BELOW UCONA RIVER (08HC001), a bit less in the spring. If it's your first time down, it's a good idea to scout the crux rapid by using the riverside trail along the canyon rim on river right, just upstream from the twin bridges near the takeout. The Heber River used to have an Environment Canada gauge, but in 2020 this is no longer active.\n2020 hydrograph and median for GOLD RIVER BELOW UCONA RIVER (08HC001). A good starting point is ~100cms on this gauge, less in the spring.\nAccess to the Lower Heber is easy, just over an hour west of Campbell River on Highway 28. Once you're in Gold River, bear left at the main junction onto Muchalat Drive, and before crossing the Gold River turn left onto Ucona Road. Follow this a short distance to a bridge over the Heber River, and turn right down into the takeout at the baseball diamond. To get to the put in, head east on Highway 28 from the main junction in town back towards Campbell River for ~4km, to a point where the road is closest to the river down a steep bank.\nThe run itself consists of two canyons separated by an open section of class II-III. The easier first canyon is class IV but with vertical walls and wood potential. The second canyon has a portage completed through a crack in the river right wall, as well as a crux class IV-V rapid that ends in an almost riverwide undercut. If you don't want to run this rapid, it's possible to hike out to the takeout on river left. After the crux, paddle around a bedrock island and take out at the baseball diamond, or continue on down the Middle (II) and Lower (IV) Gold River.\nA ledge in the first canyon of the Lower Heber River.\nDropping into the crux rapid in the second canyon of the Lower Heber River.\nAnother view of the crux rapid.\nThe main hazard in the crux rapid, a massive undercut in the runout.

Forest Ave turns into Hirsch FSR. Follow the main branch of this FSR for 5 km. Park where the road widens, where there is an overgrown road on your left.\nThe hike in can be disorientating as there's no trail, just flagging tape. Head down the overgrown road for 30 m, then head left into the bush. Follow the flagging tape. After 500 m you will hit a small creek, which you follow to the river. The put in coordinates are 54\u00b005'07.66\"N 128\u00b032'54.94\"W. If you hike to the correct spot, you will be 50 m upstream of the first rapid, 'Wake Up Call'.\nTake Out\nComing from Terrace, take a left turn 400 m before the highway bridge opposite the Hirsch Creek Campground. Follow this dirt road (it runs parallel to the Hwy) for 400 m to a car park by the river.\nDescription\nThe river starts with 2.5 km of high quality class 4-5. There has been a landslide in this section, burying one of the old rapids. It's easy to spot, portage on the right. 2.5 km downstream from the put in, a junky rapid with a large horizon line appears. This is Triple Drop. It's a 20 ft fall with a cave at the bottom. Most people who attempt to run this drop end up in the cave. Safety for this cave is mandatory if running this drop. To portage, ferry to the river right, at the top of the lead in rapid. Use ropes to pull you boats up the gully. Traverse 50 m downstream, using an old rope that's there to help. Use a rope to lower your boats down the next gully to the bottom of the falls. Seal launch into the powerful current and boof the ledge hole at the bottom on river left. You cannot scout or put safety on this ledge.\n300m downstream is 'Patapult'. It is a long cascading slot rapid. Portage the top part of the rapid on river right. You must run the bottom part of this rapid, and it is difficult to set safety. Get back in your boat in a small eddy on the right, ferry into the raging torrent and try not to flip.\nAfter 'Patapult' the river eases. There are a couple of easy rapids before you reach the take out on river right just upstream of the highway bridge.\nBe aware of rising water levels on this section. It has a large catchment and the canyon would be INTENSE above recommended flows. Keep an eye out for wood.

There is some must-run whitewater on day 2.\nTime\n4 days.\nWhen to Go\nEarly to late fall.  Spring windows are rare but possible.\nGauge\n126.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:15)\n!\nDuring the winter of 2011/2012, a massive landslide occurred on the Homathko below the Tiedemann/Mosely confluence, creating a debris field that dammed the river, catastrophically and permanently altering the majority of the notable whitewater on the typical day 3 section. While the gradient is now lost as the river flows over the debris from the avalanche forming runnable rapids, the ultra classic big water rapid The Bet and the Three Acts of Tragedy Canyons, the whitewater heart of the Homathko, no longer and will never again exist. It is hard to relate the scale of this incredible geological event without seeing it in person.\nWords can't do justice to the trip that is the Homathko River. This 4 day trip traverses the breadth of the Coast Mountains from the Chilcotin Plateau to the Pacific Ocean at Bute Inlet. While the whitewater is truly outstanding it is the journey through the huge canyons of the Homathko valley beneath the biggest mountains in BC from source to sea that solidify it as a trip with few peers. While some of the best and most challenging rapids are now gone, this is still a wonderful trip for the overall BC class V multiday experience.\nBecause of the huge icefields that feed the Homathko it's usually paddled when the majority of the water is locked down by cool temperatures from early to late fall. Look at\nthis gauge\nfound at the mouth of the river for an accurate flow report. The consensus is that flows of 150-350 cms are optimal, although trips have been run lower. Flows above 400 cms were consistently described as huge portage-fests before the landslide. If pushing higher flow, keep in mind it was possible to walk all of the big canyons on day 3 before the landslide and the parts that can't easily be walked are on day 2, which is unchanged. Spring windows are possible however one day of hot sun or a warm rain could cause a huge rise in water level.\nThe Homathko River flows out of Tatlayoko Lake on the Chilcotin Plateau due west of Williams Lake. You can drive to the put in on the lake - it takes 10-12 hours to get there from Vancouver - follow the dirt road as far south as you can along the east side of the lake. The river ends at Bute Inlet, about 200 km as the crow flies northwest of Vancouver. It is remote - you can fly with\nTweedsmuir Air\nfrom the inlet or with\nWhite Saddle Air\nfrom somewhere in the canyon back up the valley to your car.\nThis trip is typically done as a four day trip. The first day consists of paddling across the lake and down the start of the river that rarely gets harder than class II. Expect 5-6 hours to reach Nude Creek, an obvious landmark above the first hard whitewater. The best camping is several km above Nude Creek. The second day is the Great Canyon and Birthday Canyon. Doran Creek enters on the left late in the day (immediately after Birthday Canyon) marking the start of a mandatory canyon portage - with scouting for an egress the first rapids are runnable. Despite the rugged terrain the river left portage has little elevation change and takes about 2 hours. Camp at the trifluence of the Homathko, Tiedemann and Mosely with views of Mt. Waddington.\nThe third day is the big water day. The original version of the Homathko first started with the biggest rapid on the river called The Bet, followed by a series of 3 canyons called the Three Acts of Tragedy. The current version of the Homathko starts with a lake shortly after the trifluence. A long rapid now begins at the landslide site that starts big and gets progressively easier over several km until you eventually reach riverbed unaffected by the landslide. There is little evidence of the original river left behind. The last canyon - Waddington Canyon - remains unaffected and though unportageable there is virtually no whitewater in this canyon. The fourth day is the paddle out to Bute Inlet - expect 5-6 hours from Waddington Canyon to Homathko Camp. There is a dock at Homathko Camp where the plane will pick you up - don't paddle out to the ocean.\nAnd there you have the essential beta - here are a few photos to get you excited about this fantastic trip.

A different feel from the typical Coast Mountain rivers.\nClass\nV\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to moderate - despite the size of the canyon, everything can be scouted and/or portaged.\nTime\n3-5 hours.\nWhen to Go\nA mid to late season run - July/August.\nGauge\n3.83cms\u2193 (Oct 21 04:25)\n!\nIn the far flung reaches of southwest BC, on the interior fringe of the Coast Mountains lies a kayaking zone in an area that is better known for gold mines, one of\nBC's largest hydro power projects\nand fantastic backcountry skiing. For any kayaker visiting the Bralorne area, just one trip along the road from this town down to Gold Bridge will provide an unforgettable glimpse of the green water and raging rapids of the Hurley River as it cuts through an immense canyon above its confluence with the Bridge River. The Hurley River through this canyon is a memorable class V paddle with a very different feel than most Coast Mountain rivers. You'll find good (but not classic) whitewater with reasonable scouting and portaging options, a very deep canyon with fantastic scenery and plenty of remains from old gold mines. If you have the time to make it all the way out here, it's worth the trip.\nThere is\na convenient online gauge\nfor the Hurley, located a few kilometers above the put in. 10 cms gave a medium-low/medium level - probably a good minimum considering the long drive to get there. 14-15 is a good medium flow. An upper flow level has not been tested. Use your own judgment.\nThe Hurley is a long way from anywhere. Bralorne, the small mining town near the put in has a pub, a place to get gas and a motel - but that's about it. The quickest way to get there from the Sea to Sky corridor is to drive over the Hurley FSR north of Pemberton, which goes over the relatively high elevation Hurley Pass, precluding easy access to this run in the spring because of snow (2 hours driving Pemberton to Bralorne). There are longer routes to Bralorne through D'Arcy or Lillooet.\nThe take out is in the town of Gold Bridge about 10 km downstream from Bralorne at the confluence of the Hurley and the Bridge. There are several put in options. If you don't mind mank, or if the water is on the higher side, you can start right in Bralorne on the Cadwallader River, a small tributary of the Hurley. Another option that avoids the Cadwallader is to park on the back side of the tailings pond just outside of town where you can follow an old road down to the confluence of the Hurley and Cadwallader. Finally, you can start several kilometers upstream from the tailings pond at the first point the road is close to the river.\nThere are several waterfalls between the upper put in and the Cadwallader that are stout with challenging portage options. From what you can see of the Cadwallader, it looks like continuous low volume class IV. Starting at the confluence of the Hurley and Cadwallader immediately drops you in to some good class IV-IV+ whitewater. The Hurley continues with a lot of nice boogie, peppered with 5 or 6 sections of class V - all of the difficult whitewater is recognizable from above, and anything you would want to walk has a relatively easy portage option given the size of the canyon. The whitewater comes to a close shortly after the section with distinctive orange cliffs on river left. The Hurley ends at a road bridge just downstream of the confluence where the green water of the Hurley is consumed by the silty, high volume Bridge River. Enjoy this zone - it's pretty cool.\nThe long dirt road over Hurley Pass - this is by far the fastest way to get to the Hurley from the Sea to Sky zone.\nFiguring out where to go at the take out.\nDownton Lake.  The Bridge River is compounded in this huge reservoir just above its confluence with the Hurley.\nHeavy frost does not motivate one to go kayaking.  The morning before putting on the Hurley Canyon.\nFall colors in the Hurley Canyon.\nA big ledge early on in the run.\nScouting the first major stretch of whitewater, with a huge vertical wall on one side.\nSolid whitewater.\nCruising over a sticky hole - a lot of the rapids look like this one.\nMore Hurley gnar.\nThe last stretch of class V.  A gnarly exit is found at the end of this one.\nThe green water of the Hurley being engulfed by the heavy silt of the Bridge River.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

the trip is well worth the effort for its great whitewater and awesome camping along the river.\nLevel and Gauge\nCrews generally paddle this section when the Stikine is a bit high (400-600 cms).\u00a0 While the Iskut has an online gauge, it\u2019s 100 km downstream and below multiple significant tributaries so it\u2019s not very accurate for this section.\u00a0 There is however a convenient gauge rock.\u00a0 On hwy 37 a couple of hundred meters north of Burrage Creek there is a pull-out spot that looks out over the river where you can see an obvious gauge rock in the middle of the current (see photo below).\u00a0 The photo shows an ideal medium flow.\u00a0 If water is lapping over the rock, then the section is high.\u00a0 If the rock is covered, the section is too high.\u00a0 The lower section from Burrage Creek down can handle more water than Willow Creek to Burrage Creek.\nTake Out\nThe one unfortunate component of this trip is access to the takeout.\u00a0 The road to the takeout is also the road to the Forest Kerr IPP, which is gated.\u00a0 The gate is 2 km from the highway.\u00a0 The walk from the take out bridge to this gate is 5 km of dirt road.\u00a0 On top this is, this bridge is over the Ningunsaw River approximately 3 km above its confluence with the Iskut meaning you have to walk up the Ningunsaw from the confluence to reach the \u2018take out\u2019 bridge. \u00a0 Despite the fact that the road is gated, it passes through crown land and we have been told by the BC Government that we are allowed to walk this road.\nTo reach the takeout get on hwy 37 and head north.\u00a0 After reaching the Bell II lodge and gas station continue north for 45 km.\u00a0 Take the left signposted \u2018Alta Gas NorthWest Projects\u2019.\u00a0 Continue down this road for 2 km to the gate.\u00a0 Park out of the way.\nBurrage Creek can be used as a takeout for the upper portion of this run.\u00a0 The hwy bridge over Burrage Creek is 83 km north of Bell II.\u00a0 There is a pullout spot just before the creek on the right.\u00a0 Walk up the Burrage to the highway.\nPut In\n105 km North of Bell II is the Willow Creek FSR.\u00a0 500 m after driving over Willow Creek take a left.\u00a0 Drive for 3 km until you reach the bridge over the Iskut.\u00a0 Park out of the way.\nThe River\nThe whitewater on the Iskut offers good variety with miles of nice read and run connecting the dots between a dozen or so rapids and sections of solid class IV-V.\u00a0 Much of the river is in a canyon, and while you can scout everything the portage options in some areas are tough.\u00a0 The best way to break up this run would be to paddle from Willow Creek to Burrage Creek on day 1 (short day), Burrage to below the whitewater on day 2 (excellent camping) and then deal with the exit on day 3.\u00a0 It\u2019s possible to paddle from Burrage all the way down and hike out in one long day if you\u2019re pressed for time.\nFrom the Willow Creek put in the river is wide open and the scenery is amazing.\u00a0 There is about 10 km of flatwater before reaching the first rapids.\u00a0 This first day down to Burrage Creek is mainly a series of short, sheer canyons and one notable class V rapid.\u00a0 You quickly enter the main canyon below Burrage Creek so you\u2019ll want to try and find a campsite at or very near the confluence of the Iskut and the Burrage.\nThe second day of whitewater is the best one.\u00a0 There\u2019s a fair bit to consider \u2013 scout and/or portage as necessary.\u00a0 Everything is runnable, though there is one enormous hole that is likely only favorable at low water.\u00a0 The big rapids are all obvious, and remember that the crumbly canyon wall on this river mean the rapids can and do change over the years.\u00a0 Once the rapids fade away it\u2019s a fairly long slog to the Ningunsaw confluence, but there are many good campsites if you\u2019re doing a 3 day.\nThe confluence of the Ningunsaw is obvious (broad valley entering from the left) but if in doubt GPS the location as you don\u2019t want to miss it.\u00a0 Hike up the broad valley until you reach the road bridge and then hike out the road to the gate.\u00a0 Many groups have had good luck hitching a ride with workers coming and going on the road.\u00a0 Enjoy this northern BC adventure!\nContributed by Ali Marshall and Steve Arns\nThe gauge rock from the road.\nClose up of the gauge rock.\nGreat northern BC scenery on the paddle in.\nPaddle in on a beautiful fall day.\nCamp at the Iskut/Burrage confluence.\nCanyon on Day 2.\nDay 2.\nOne of the first bigger rapids on day 2.\nA classic corner on day 2.\nStart of the walk up the Ningunsaw.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

On Natadelseen Lake, paddle 1km southwest and look for the Lower Cascade Falls Trail on river right at the outlet. Do not paddle into the Iskut River below Natadelseen Lake, as Cascade Falls is just downstream.

Spring is possible\nGauge\n8.26cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:15)\n!\nFlow:\nThe gauge is an approximation from the Perry whose watershed is geographically similar. Can generally be run when the gauge reads 10-50. There is a sharp triangle shaped rock at the take out bridge that makes for a good visual gauge. Rock fully visible: low bony not fun. Water pillowing against rock: low bony runnable. Water pillowing to tip of rock: low medium. Water spilling over rock: true medium. Rock barely visible: medium high. What rock?: Super Juicy Fun (Class V).\nDescription:\nThis section consists of a short warm up of class 2 ending in one class 3 with a nice boof on the left before the first waterfall. The main rapids are numbered.\n#1: Ever the punisher. Run the far right channel and boof twice. The key to success relies in not boofing the second drop too early. The bottom hole looks sticky but it easy to work your way out of. Swim/rescue right before #2.\n#2: The cave on river left makes this by far the most consequential on this run. Slalom eddy hop from the left eddy through the notch to the river right eddy before holding a strong right to left angle through the slide to avoid the cave. At high water boof the flake far left (or beneath the flake) taking care not to get launched across the river into the cave. At all levels beware the nasty ugly pin spot in the centre. Portage up the obvious climb on the cliff river right.\nEnjoy three boogie rapids before #3; the last one is a sweet whale tail boof. Eddy out left to scout #3.\n#3: Climbing up through the hole in the rock above the eddy offers you a cool platform to scout from. A hiking trail starts here and heads all the way to the takeout. Run far right of the left channel being careful not to get flipped against the wall by the boulder. Charge the exit boof with some sweet left-right momentum and take solace in the fact that an easy swim/rescue awaits you in the small pool below.\n#4 is a sweet multi-faceted slide and by far the most fun rapid on the run. Run the slide centre (further right than you think) and aim back left to reconnect to the autoboof without getting launched into the undercut river right. The next two drops have sneaky rocks in the landing so be weary of boofs that look too good to be true. Go hard left or right of the main flow. An alt line on the slide is to launch the rooster tail far right (pictured in the banner photo). It\u2019s scary but it has been beatered and freewheeled by many locals without serious consequences. Just be sure to gather your speed away from the undercut before reconnecting with the main flow. The run out is fun and boofy.\n#5. Scout right or left after the tight right corner when the river picks up again. Portage right. Different levels offer different lines on this bad boi but the challenge remains to retain rightward momentum away from the sieves on the left. The hole at the bottom flushes but can be boofed if you nail your line and timing in the top half. Safety can be set from on top of the sieve river left.\n#6 WALLRIDE TIME! Sneak through the boulders in the main flow left of centre before gathering as much left-right momentum as possible across the lip. If you do it right you can clear your entire boat out of the water onto the right wall as a gallery of beaters gawk from shore. The left pocket gets ugly at higher water but you can work your way out of it.\nEnjoy class 3 boogie all the way to the takeout bridge.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Responds well to rainfall.\nContributed by Ali Marshall\nThis hidden gem of a run tucked away in the North Coast rainforest west of Terrace delivers adventure of all sorts. The only road access is on the other side of the Skeena River valley, so getting to the put in involves ferrying across this large river coupled with a classic BC bushwhack up into the mountains. Those who sacrifice the sweat required to undertake this mission will be rewarded with the most unique, granite bedrock formed whitewater in the region.\nHeading west from the city of Terrace, drive 78 km past the Kitsumkalum River bridge to a point just opposite of the Khtada River valley. The train tracks running along the highway will be very close at this point, and if you squint hard enough you can see the last rapid of the run dropping into the Skeena. With no convenient place to park it is advisable squeeze as far off the road as possible.\nPaddle 2 km across the Skeena, heading straight for that last rapid of the Khtada. The Skeena is tidally influenced here, so there may be some exposed sand bars to get out and walk across. To gauge the level, observe the final rapid of the Khtada. If it is bony, it's too low; if it looks like it's pumping, it's quite high.\nThe trailhead to begin your trek into the woods is located on the river right side and can be found with a quick recon into the woods. This overgrown trail will likely present a large amount of blown down timber blocking the path and backpack-style carry systems are not recommended. Hike for roughly 2 km to a large pond, paddle to the far end, and then hike 150 m in a WSW direction and you will find the flatwater stretch upstream of the goods.\nThe run consists of three large slides interspersed with very fun class 4 rapids. The first slide is the very first piece of whitewater you will encounter, and it should serve as a personal gauge of the run for every member of the group. If you are not willing to run the first slide, you will likely walk the other major slides as well. All drops are easily portaged.\nBring some lunch as this is a full day mission.\nThe path across the Skeena.

Can feel a little like fight club in there with unpredictable, surging waves hitting you from all angles.\nThe character of this run is continuous, cold river running with the glacial source of the river less than 12 hours upstream.\nHigh water leaves very few slow places and eddies for cleaning up swims and yet still isn't deep enough to mitigate the risk of hitting rocks while swimming.\nMedium-high portage shotgun from the bottom during one of the Kicking Horse Kayak festival's races\nPutting in at Palliser gives you a short warm up of class 2 before you pass under a cable car which signifies the beginning of some really nice class 3 for the next 1/2 km. After this the river mellows into a few km of class 2 before the biggest rapid of this section; portage and shotgun. You will know you are getting close because the river takes a right hand turn with a large logjam on the left. Just downstream of the logjam is is a sign at the top of a nice eddy that reads \"Portage and Shotgun Scout\".\nNot obvious unless you are looking for it, this sign is just below a logjam on river left\nBeware of commercial rafting trips pulling in here and make room for those big floating undercuts to park at the beach. From the scout one can see a bit over half of the rapid, or it is possible to walk downstream and see the whole thing. Part or all of the rapid can be portaged on river left. After portage and shotgun there is nothing else as big or continuous and the whole rest of the run can be boat scouted and all the biggest holes can be avoided.\nThe top part of Portage shotgun at high water\nHigh water provides fun surging waves to toss you around and fast, powerful eddies to play in as well as a few monster holes, while low water leaves plenty of eddies and opens up more boofs and slalom moves.\nThe takeout is at the Kicking Horse rest area, a few km after passing underneath the really tall highway bridge. Make sure not to miss this takeout as the\nclass 5 section\nof the Kicking Horse begins at the rest area.\nFun, surging waves at high water, indicative of the character of the run\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

This run starts off flat but picks up quickly. After the first couple of class 3 rapids the continuous class 4 starts. A kilometer or so of fast read and run leads to a pair of eddies on either side of the river next to a set of train lights. Scouting from here is recommended if you are showing yourself down this section of river. From the train lights to the next good eddy is a couple hundred meters of very continuous class 4/4+. The next eddy, the \"big rock eddy\" provides a great place to stop and scout all the way down to the crux, the Bridge Drop. Immediately after the Bridge Drop comes Split Rock, after which the run eases back to continuous read and run class 4.\nA swim anywhere in this section would be bad. The Kicking Horse is cold, continuous, shallow, and full of sharp rocks. All of these factors add up to make it more consequential than it is hard.\nFlows: This section has been run as low as the river gets (~10 cms) and almost as high as it gets (~300 cms). Ultra low water still provides fun class 4 and ultra high water serves up giant crashing waves of incredible power and about 2 km with no possibility of stopping.\u00a0 Mere mortals usually wait until the river drops to around 120 cms to think about running this section.\nContinuous whitewater upstream of the crux (photo by Garrett Quin).\nThe Bridge Drop at medium flows (Photo by Garrett Quinn).\nThe Bridge Drop at ultra low water in mid November.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Fast, surging waves, powerful holes, satisfying eddies to play with.\nClass\nIV\nScouting / Portaging\nEverything can be scouted from the train tracks on river right. At normal flows competent paddlers can boat scout everything.\nTime\n1 hour\nWhen to Go\nAny time the river isn't frozen.\nGauge\n10.9cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:40)\n!\nThe bread and butter for locals. Great river running that remains high quality from flood to low water and finishes up in downtown Golden.\nAlthough the put in has become less convenient since CP installed a gate where the access road meets the highway, this remains the best bang for your buck run for anyone in Golden.\nNormal flows serve up 4 km of non-stop class 4. This is followed by a few km of class 2-3 before an access point where people who are not up to running the Lower Canyon can join for the \"Lower-Lower\". The last class 3 rapid on the run is known as The Playwave, a great surf wave with eddy service on both sides of the river that playboats and longboats can both have fun on. After this the river flattens out for the last couple of km's of floating into town.\nAlthough local raft guides have a name for every wave and rock in this section, it can be summed up by \"when in doubt, go right\". The largest rapids are all on right hand corners with large headwalls on river left.\nLike all of the Kicking Horse, the water in here is fast, cold and milky-grey, which can make it both difficult to read, and consequential to misread.\nAs the water drops from flood stage it progressively turns from waves to holes to eddies. High water has people staying right down the middle except for a few huge holes to dodge. Medium water reveals more holes, although most are boofable or punchable if you are feeling up to it, and low water creates a playground of eddies and jet ferries. After 10 years of paddling this section most days of the summer I can still find new places to go, eddies to catch and moves to try. The fast and dynamic nature of the whitewater, combined with the myriad or rocks that form its features make this section a true gift for anyone who wants to improve their boat control.\nFlows: Anything above 180 cms is getting quite high, 120 cms feels pretty medium and below 60 cms things are starting to get low. This run has been paddled from as high to as low as the river gets. Although you will get called crazy for running it on either of the far ends of the spectrum, it still goes and is still worth it.\nAfter work group paddle (Photo by Ben Hawthorne)\n.\nLocal rafting scene. This section provides great class 4 rafting in the late summer when most rivers have mellowed out substantially. Recent access issues with CP rail have limited commercial use to heli-access only. (Photo by Glacier Raft Company).\nContinuous wave trains. This rapid is the most aptly named of all the rapids named \"Wave Train\" as there are a set of very busy train tracks right next to the river. Rafting customers love to wave at the train (instead of paddling) while running Wave Train. (Photo by Glacier Raft Company).\nRounding the corner before the last big rapid.

Fall rain provides frequent high water.\nGauge\n83.7cms\u2191 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nContributed by Ali Marshall and Tania Millen\nThe 'Kalum Canyons', is the bread and butter intermediate difficulty section for Terrace paddlers. At high water, an incredible surf wave called Dog Dish is a part of what make this one of the best play sections in BC.\nTo reach the take out, head west from Terrace on Hwy 16 toward Prince Rupert. On the edge of town, hang a right onto Kalum Lake Dr / Nisga'a Hwy 113, following signs for Rosswood and New Aiyanch. Drive north for 7 km, cross the Deep Creek bridge, then turn left at the top of the hill onto Deep Creek Rd. Follow this gravel road to a dead end (cul-de-sac). If your vehicle has high clearance, take the access road straight ahead. If you have low clearance, park and walk. Follow this access road for 500 m, the road splits, keep to the right. Drive through some deep puddles, when you hit the river, you're at the takeout.\nFor access to the put in, meet up with a Terrace local. Access is on private property. This is an incredibly valuable resource for the community so please be respectful. There is no camping or fishing allowed at the put in. Terrace paddlers do this section daily. The best way to contact the locals is on the\nTerrace Paddling Community\nFacebook page.\nOnce on the river, half a kilometer down from the put-in lies the First Canyon (class 3). Scout or portage on river right. Halfway down this rapid lies a wave called Dog Dish. There is eddy service on river right. The best flows for this play feature are 4.2 m (210 cms) - 4.6 m (285 cms) on the online gauge. 4.6 m is optimal for short playboats. Above this level, up to 4.8 m (330 cms), produces a huge green wave which is amazing surfing for longer boats. Just downstream is a wave-hole called Yankee Doddle. When Dog Dish is working this feature can become quite powerful. Just around the corner on river right is a nice surf wave called Million-Dollar Wave, which forms at most levels. The river eases for a couple of kilometers. A long wave train leads to the Second Canyon (class 3 / 4). At the entrance is a large eddy on the right, scout from here. To portage is difficult, but you can do it by hiking around the canyon rim on the right. The simplest line through the rapid is down the middle, keeping away from the powerful boils and eddies. Below 4.2 m (200 cms) a powerful wave hole forms called Slap Wave. It lurks halfway down the rapid. It is easy to spot and pass on the right. This canyon can be run at extremely high flows but the consequence of a swim could be severe. There is another 1 km of fun wave trains before the canyon opens and the whitewater ends. 2 km of flat-water lead to the take-out when the river splits and you need to keep to the left to get out.\nTake out directions.\nKalum second canyon.

Remote and with only a handful of descents the Klastline is a good option for anyone who plans to be in the area and wants to run something other than the Stikine. Some class 4 bedrock rapids, 2 big waterfalls (one that has yet to be run) and some steep boulder gardens make for varied if not \"ultra-classic\" whitewater.\nClass\nV\nScouting / Portaging\nEverything can be scouted. There are 2 large waterfalls that are most likely portages\nTime\n3 days\nWhen to Go\nLate August - early September, when the Stikine is in.\nGauge\n218.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:40)\n!\nThis is a remote adventure. Best run when the Stikine is at a medium flow. Fly in to Nuttlude Lake and spend around 3 days making your way to the takeout at the Tahltan/Stikine confluence.\nThe creek flowing out of Nuttlude lake is mostly meandering flatwater with one short bit of whitewater an hour before hitting the Klastline confluence. Not too far downstream of the confluence is a short canyon that begins with a waterfall.\nEntrance falls to the 1st canyon\nA short ways after the 1st canyon of the Klastline some class 3, vertical walls and a horizon line indicate the second canyon. The 2nd canyon has yet to be run due to wood but looks interesting. A 20 footer into a vertically walled gorge.\nEntrance falls into the 2nd canyon\nAfter the 2nd canyon there is some mellow whitewater followed by some really nice 4+/5 bedrock rapids. Not long after a beautiful 10 foot waterfall is the first big waterfall.\nBeautiful 10 footer\nYet to be run big waterfall\nThis one has yet to be run and has been portaged on river right with ~1hr of teamwork and ropework.\nPut in after the un-run waterfall\nA section of fun boulder gardens leads to the 2nd big waterfall (also portaged on river right with teamwork and ropework, but slightly shorter than the 1st one). Keep on your toes between the waterfalls as the rapids get more difficult and continuous and lead right into the big one. It is actually a double drop, each ~30 feet tall and has at least one descent.\n2nd big waterfall\nView of the 2nd big waterfall from downstream\nAfter the 2nd waterfall it is all boulder gardens to the Stikine confluence. Steep and continuous, these would become tricky to run safely at high water. stay extra alert for wood as the area had a huge fire which has created unstable slopes resulting in landslides bringing wood into the river.\nOnce you hit the Stikine confluence it is all friendly big water class 3 to the takeout.\nCredit to Jason Cathers, whose\nblog\ninformed the first half of this description since the author accidentally flew into the wrong lake (we blindly followed the original blogpost which has since been corrected that named Buckley Lake as the put in, a lesson in doing your research when flying in to remote multi-days!) and did a day of bushwhacking down a wood infested creek and past a giant waterfall before hitting the Klastline below the 1st 2 canyons.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

A lengthy river full of complex boulder rapids in a lush canyon. Unfortunately it is dewatered for an IPP.\nClass\nV at medium levels.\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to strenuous river level portaging.\nTime\n3-8 hours.\nWhen to Go\nRuns unpredictably after heavy rain.  4 possible days of releases per year.\nGauge\nKokish\n!\nThe Kokish River of northern Vancouver Island is far off the beaten track for most kayaking parties. This is truly unfortunate - the Kokish is one of, if not the best class V run found on the Island, and sadly it was dewatered in 2014 because of the construction of an IPP. This river is a lengthy paddle that builds slowly into a long barrage of big, clean boulder rapids that will challenge everyone and leave you in awe not only because of the quality of the whitewater but also the lush rainforest canyon. It's well worth the long drive and will definitely not disappoint.\nDetermining flows on the Kokish is done using\nan online gauge\nprovided by the company that runs the IPP on this river. It is currently unclear what the gauge numbers mean, but the previous range was about 15-25 cms, with the mid range sweet spot around 20-22 cms. It appears as if the gauge estimates total river flow and does not measure the actual observed flow in the diverted reach. Thankfully there are 4 days of releases per year - see the\nKokish River Hydro\npage for more information.\nThe Kokish is on the northern tip of Vancouver Island, near the town of Port McNeill. Being generous, it is about 5 hours north of Nanaimo. To reach the actual river, you'll need to drive north on highway 19. After passing Nimpkish Lake, you will come to an obvious sign indicating a turn to Telegraph Cove. Follow this road. If you reach Port McNeill on the 19 you've gone too far. Follow the road to Telegraph Cove and you will eventually cross the Kokish. This is the take out; you won't miss the massive powerhouse there. Follow the West Kokish logging road south to Ida Lake and put in at the bridge over the river just below the lake, or at the dam just downstream. There is excellent camping on the lake.\nOut of the lake, there is a short stretch of moving water before you'll reach the intake structure. You have to portage the intake structure. Immediately below the project is a gnarly 2-tiered slot-to-massive-hole combo drop. Scout carefully and/or portage on the right. Below here things are mellow for a while, then it starts to build through nice read and run class III and class IV. About half way through the run the difficult whitewater begins. The first big class V rapid is obvious from above - it is a long multi-move boulder drop that ends in a narrow bedrock canyon. From this rapid until you just about reach the take out bridge are a stacked series of complicated, clean class IV to V boulder rapids. You can scout everything, and most things can be portaged with varying levels of difficulty. It is awesome - just keep an eye out for wood!\nSignificant construction at the start of the Kokish.\nYes, this is micro hydro.\nFun read and run in the upper reaches of the river.\nThe start of the good stuff.\nSneaking the first big class V rapid - one of the bigger rapids of the run.\nPortaging something gnarly.\nTypical downstream view.\nSome of the best the Kokish has to offer.\nThe last major puzzle of the Kokish.\nKokish River crew - May 2013.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The Upper Koksilah (III) is immediately upstream. Look for these runs and others in an upcoming guidebook by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nThis section is runnable at a variety of flows, and will spike up and down very quickly. Look for wood floating down the river as a clue that it may still be spiking upwards. A bare minimum flow is 10cms, which will be scrapey but all the rapids still go. A better entry level low-medium flow is 20-30cms. Some of the best padded medium flows are in the 50cms range, when the river comes alive with many surf waves and dynamic eddies. As flows approach 100cms, the river becomes boily class IV-V.\n2015 hydrograph for KOKSILAH RIVER AT COWICHAN STATION (08HA003).\nTo get there, drive about an hour north of Victoria on Highway 1, and turn left on Koksilah Rd. for just over 2km to a bridge over the river next to Jack Fleetwood Memorial Park. The parking for the put in trail is 10km up Riverside Drive on river left, at the north access for the Kinsol Trestle. From here, hike ~500m south along the Cowichan Valley Trail, and drop down to river level below the trestle.\nThe run is mostly read and run class III-IV through open rapids with some bedrock shelves and boulders, a few small canyons, and one bigger ledge. Following some read and run warmup, the first notable rapid is a triple drop, scouted on the right. After a boulder fence and some boogie water is Marble Falls, a ~3m ledge on either side of a bedrock island. The preferred left channel goes better at some levels than others, while the right channel has issues with a fish ladder and a retentive hole. There are several tricky portage options, and if this run is near your skill limit you'll be better off having a local show you down. After the crux ledge, there is some more read and run, one more big rapid, and a scenic paddle out through a sandstone canyon.\nLooking downstream from the put in, showing the character of most of the run.\nA neat put in under the Kinsol Trestle, a recently restored logging railway bridge.\nThe final ledge in the triple drop.\nMarble Falls.\nMarble Falls left channel.\nThe last rapid at near minimum flows.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

An adventurous day of rapids, shuttling and portaging.\nClass\nIV-V at low to medium flows\nScouting / Portaging\nModerate to difficult.  Some must-run whitewater and a complex near-mandatory portage.\nTime\n4-6 hours.\nWhen to Go\nFall through spring after rain.  Runs when most other things are low.\nGauge\n1.25cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:20)\n!\nLens Creek is one of the local favorites on southern Vancouver Island. Unlike many runs in the area the Lens needs a few days after a rain for it to drop down to low enough levels to be run. Containing some tight canyons, a standout class V rapid, classic Island mank and an exciting portage, this run should be on your list when you're in the south when the water is low. Not a river that can easily be lapped, the Lens is a full day of adventure kayaking.\nIt will be virtually impossible to find the Lens without a Backroads Map Book, or local knowledge. The take out is easy enough - it is at the southern end of the Lens Creek Main near where it joins the Harris Creek Road (the paved road from Port Renfrew to Lake Cowichan). A large bridge crosses the river here. The put in is at the next bridge approximately 7-8 km upstream. The shortest shuttle is run along the river left logging road, however as of April 2012 that road is in rough shape and may not be passable without serious 4x4.\nThe other, much longer option is to drive the Harris Creek Road around to the north end of the Lens Main. This is a major turn off about 8-9 km south of Mesachie Lake. Follow the Lens Main south to reach the put in bridge, generally favoring the east side of the river. To complicate things the road may be washed out in places and the north end of the Lens Main is sometimes gated. From put in to take out using the Harris Creek road is at least 1 hour each way.\nThe water level on the Lens is visual only, although the\nHarris Creek gauge\ncan be used to get a good idea of what's going on in the area.\nBC-WW\nsuggests a range of 2.5-4.5 cms. We suggest 3.5 cms as a low but tolerable level. If the rapid above the put in bridge looks healthy you are in for a spicy day. Generally speaking it should look low - the canyon is much, much narrower than at the bridge. High levels are largely untested, and keep in mind that the Harris gauge might not always correlate to what's happening in the Lens drainage.\nFrom the put in, the Lens meanders along and quickly enters a low slung, narrow canyon with perhaps 10 class IV-IV+ rapids. Nothing is particularly memorable except for the scenery. The initial canyon subsides to some pleasant floating with amazing old growth forest on the banks. Boulder rapids build as the river slowly drops in to the second canyon of the run. The head of the second canyon contains several congested boulder rapids that are easily inspected or portaged. The rapid in the heart of the second canyon that is far larger than anything encountered so far is called Stairway to Hell. A challenging class V rapid, it is the highlight of the run and only the top can be easily portaged.\nBelow Stairway is a manky mandatory rapid, a small ledge and a clean boof into a wood-filled room. Below this boof it is critical to get out on the left. Up next is a burly waterfall with a difficult entrance. Despite having been run, it is not appealing and most people will portage. The portage involves jumping into the impact zone of the falls, swimming to shore and roping boats and paddles to those who jumped first. One more fun rapid and then the action is over - all that's left is the long cruise to the take out bridge.\nThe rapid upstream of the put in bridge.  This is a low level.\nRelaxing at the put in while others run the lengthy shuttle.\nThis is the general scene you'll find in the first canyon.\nA random rapid in the first canyon.\nAn mediocre photo of one of the big boulder piles at the head of the second canyon.\nRallying in to the start of Stairway to Hell.  This about 1/3 of the rapid.\nThe end of Stairway to Hell.  The last drop falls in to a large boily hole.\nThe end of Stairway, from the bottom.\nA nice boof.

Please respect the speed limit signs on the roads and be courteous where you park.\nThe bridge across the lake near the start of the run.\nThis section runs year-round, even in winter it's possible to paddle as low as 25cm/s which is about as low as the river ever gets! It goes as high as 1000cm/s in high water freshets!\u00a0 It can be done as a day-trip or a multi-day adventure. This run is suitable for kayaks and whitewater canoes and would make an excellent rafting trip too!\nGood flows start at 50cm/s and late summer flows will be around 250cm/s some rapids will become significantly boiley at high water.\nThe First Rapid at the exit of the lake - Photo Arturo Tondelli\nGetting to this river is easy but be sure to screenshot all this information and collect pin-drops as there is no cell service anywhere along this run. Access is mainly from Highway 99, head to Pemberton, turn right at Mount Currie Gas Station, and turn right onto the In-shuk-ch Road.\u00a0 A 4WD vehicle is recommended for this unpaved road, in winter parts of the road can be steep and slippery especially if you're on the West Lillooet Road (which runs on the west side of the river).\u00a0 Road access from the south from Mission/Harrison area is possible but the road is variable and suggest for only high-clearance 4WD cars.\u00a0 Carry a spare tire, puncture repair kits and pumps! To the take out of the full run is about 73km of FSR driving.\u00a0 Google Maps may try and take you across the bridge and down the west road passed Baptiste but the road is smoother / faster and more frequently graded along the In-shuk-ch instead.\nThe put-on options for this run are numerous.\u00a0 If you wanted a multi-day canoe trip you could start up in Pemberton, or right at the top of the lake near the start of the In-shuck-ch FSR. This would add an optional 30km+ of flat-water paddling, there are a few rec sites along the way at Strawberry Point, Lizzie Point and Driftwood Point.\nIf you had a lot of vehicles it may be best to launch at the Bridge as other locations have limited parking, this would add 4km of lake paddling.\nThere is a route down from the In-shuck-ch FSR at about between 33km and 34km mile markers. It's a steep 20 minute walk down.\nThe long walk down on the east bank to the put-in! - Photo Arturo Tondelli\nTo avoid a big walk drive up to the bridge and drive back down the west road and put in at a pull-out just before Baptiste where the road is about 3meters above the lake instead.\nThere are also multiple take-out options.\u00a0 Before 2020 the main take-out used for the upper run was the Tseq/Tsek Hot Springs Campground (also known as Skookumchuck Hot Springs and St Agnes Well).\u00a0 The hot-springs were closed during Covid-19 and in 2022 it was announced that the campground was going to be closed permanently. \u00a0 The Canadian government purchased the title to this land and the lot is now held in trust for the Skatin Community.\u00a0 Currently the Skatin Chief and Council have made the decision to close the campground permanently and have the land and hot springs only for Cultural use for the eleven communities of the St'at'imc Nation.\u00a0 The road access to the springs has been gated but is currently not blocked.\u00a0 It is not suggested we use the hot springs as the take-out for now.\u00a0 A Skatin run campground will be developed in the future.\nInstead you can take out on the west road roughly opposite where Rogers Creek enters, or it is possible to take out on river right a few km after the class III/IV Skookumchuck Rapids.\u00a0 It makes the shuttle more efficient as you'll start and finish on the same side and you don't have to walk down a long slope.\nThe Upper run is class II/III- with big waves until you reach \"Island Drop\" about halfway down the run.\u00a0 The river splits around an island and the rejoining of the channels creates quite swirly water.\u00a0 The left channel was nice Class III at low flows!\nAn Upper run is ~15km and will take 1.5 hours to 2 hours.\nThe left channel at island Drop at very low winter water levels - Photo Arturo Tondelli\nThe lower run starts with \"Skookumchuck Rapid\" (III+, -IV at high water) and a steep river-wide drop which should be scouted. The community of Skatin is just below this rapid but currently it is not recommended to take-out in this area.\nSkookumchuck Rapid - Class III /IV - Photo Scott McBride\nYou'll see a lot of traditional Fishing Gear along the river - Photo Scott McBride\n\u201cThe community of Skatin (or SkookumChuck) is located on the east side of the Lillooet River, on the 19-Mile Post of the old Harrison-Lillooet wagon road (about 35 kilometres from the head of Harrison Lake). Before the arrival of European settlers, this community was considered to be the largest on the lower Lillooet River, comparable in size to the pre-contact village of present-day Mount Currie (or Lilwat\u2019ul). A moderately sized waterfall on the Lillooet River, about 1 kilometre north of the community, had a significant effect on the size of the community in prehistoric times as well as today. The fall is now commonly known as SkookumChuck Rapids, but the Ucwalmicwts [oo-kwal-MEWK] (Lower Lillooet dialect) word for this fall is qmemps (k-MEMP-sh). This site was and remains to be a very abundant fishery, the most abundant on the Lillooet River. Colonial settlers and ethnographers have noted it in historic documents as early as the late 1850\u2019s.\nTypical scenery - Photo Arturo Tondelli\nBelow Skookumchuck, the river moves fast, but rapids are only minor, the river flows through a long beautiful class II/II+ isolated canyon.\nTake out at the bridge before Sloquet Creek.\nTake out Bridge for the full run - Photo Scott McBride\nIt is 42km for full run and it takes about 4-8hours depending on flow and motivation to paddle! The water is very cold, watch out for wood as always, particularly in braided channels around islands!\nOther beta,\nSloquet Hot Springs are also near the takeout of the main run and is well worth a visit!\nThe stunning\nRogers Creek\nwaterfalls are not far off-route, if the flows are right it's well worth doing!\nThere are some other runs in the area which have seen limited descents, Tuwasus Creek has some logging which is opening up access to a nice class 3 section, and Snowcap Creek.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The whole river is only 2km long, linking Victoria and Alice Lakes. After a couple optional manky class V slides, the best part of the run is a short class III canyon right down to a great campsite on Alice Lake. This campground makes a great base to explore the Alice Lake zone. Other rivers in the zone are the Marble and Benson Rivers.\nFlows\nThe Link River (upper Marble River on some maps) flows out of the large Victoria Lake, and is likely runnable consistently from October through May with the exception of very dry spells. Level is judged visually at the Southeast Main FSR bridge or at the campsite.

After passing Marble River Provincial Park, but before reaching Port Alice, turn left onto the Southeast Main and follow this ~6km to the Link River Campground.\nThe lower put in is reached by taking the West Main (river left) to a bridge over the tiny Jeune Creek.

This puts you at the base of the slides, and at the start of the 1km section of class III down to the campsite on Alice Lake. At the lower put in, you can explore around to scout the big slide.

Like most rivers on the Island, this piece of kayaking eye candy is surrounded by lush coastal rainforest and the water runs clear and green. Photos of the drop speak for themselves. While it is not a trivial stretch of whitewater, for those up for the action it is something to put on the list of Island classics to check out.\nThis drop is found in Little Qualicum Falls Provincial Park on highway 4 (the road to Tofino) near the small town of Coombs. It's approximately 1 hour from the ferry terminal in Nanaimo. The park is well signed once you get on highway 4. Drive in and park at the end of the road and use the extensive trail network to scout and access the river. If you're there in the summer, be prepared to be swarmed by onlookers as you run the drops.\nThe best way to see if Little Qualicum is running is to go and look at the drop, or you can check the\nLittle Qualicum online gauge\n. It's runnable at a variety of levels, and it seems like 10-15 cms is a good medium range. Generally, Little Qualicum runs when other runs in the area are low. The Little Qualicum River flows out of Cameron Lake, which is fed by the classic\nCameron River\n, so if you hear the Cameron is low, Little Qualicum might be good to go - Little Qualicum is usually high when the Cameron is running.\nThe line on the falls is obvious. Set what safety you can, and if you don't want to run the tricky entrance drop it's possible to seal launch from river left. The dangers are also obvious. After the 2 big drops there is a runout ledge with a nasty hole. You can hike out shortly after, or you can continue downstream a short way to run some smaller ledges further downstream.\nMaxi Kniewasser dropping the second falls.

Follow this road to an intersection at about 3.5 km (N49 42.404 W123 06.308). Turn left \u2013 there may be a sign pointing you to \u201cwhitewater kayaking\u201d. Take the second road to the right after about 2 km. From here it is about 1 km down a steep washed out road to the river. Park in the open area at the top if you don\u2019t like the looks of the road or if the gate is locked. To get to the take-out return to Hwy 99 and turn north. There are two options for taking out. To do the longer run drive north through Squamish on Hwy 99 for 4.5 km. Turn left on Centennial Way and after 500 meters right onto Government Road where you will cross the Mamquam. The take-out is at this bridge. For the shorter version of the run, stay on the Hwy for another kilometer (5.5 km from Mamquam FSR). Turn right onto Mamquam Road. Drive about 2 kilometers past a golf course. Park just past the small bridge over Mashiter Creek.\nDescription: This is a great beginner run or park and practice spot. At the right level, there is even a nice play wave, called \u201cPaula\u2019s Wave\u201d. For park and play put in at the pipeline and paddle down about 500 m to a gravel beach on the left. You will find a well trodden trail back to the parking lot. If you are ready for it, carry your boat upstream from the pipeline for some great class III boulder garden action. The rest of the run is pretty straight forward with some short drops and lots of floating.\nThe rapids above the pipeline can be paddled at very low flows -- more or less year round.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Leave your car at the beach by the lake. The turn off is pretty obvious on google maps. It's the only road off the Shelter Bay Main Line for 5k.\nFlows\nThis page now shows flow information directly from Pingston dam at the top, but we are still working to understand the correlation between that gauge and runnability.\nThe old correlation was based on the\nCranberry Creek gauge\n: flows between 5 and 10cms are generally a good indicator.\nDescription\nAfter about 100m of class 2 boogie the river turns left and drops into the first canyon. Narrow and pushy. Hop from eddy to eddy or scout from the steep bank river left. As the canyon opens up you come to a juicy 4ft cauldron with a nice calm pool after. If you swim into this pool swim right hard. Eddy out right and climb up to scout the big slide. Saskatoon berries grow on the side of this cliff so you can have a little snack whilst you freak out about the horrible life decisions that led you to be on the edge of this cliff contemplating hucking your flesh prison into the abyss below using only a thin layer of plastic to protect you, if it helps with your decision making at all. The portage down and across the scree on the right is just as terrifying. The 20ft drop directly after the 70ft slide looks super sieved out but might go if you\u2019re feeling like rolling the dice. Portage this around the super slimy and slippery boulders on the right if you aren\u2019t feeling superhuman and put in below. A short section of read and run class 3 leads to a horizon line formed by a bedrock shelf at a left turn in the river. Scout for wood from river left. The rapid is a short ledge boof into a juicy slide that rolls into a manky boulder garden. Eddy out left to scout the next drop. Two smaller ledges that form nice boofs left of centre. The canyon opens up here as you come out to the last triple set out to the lake. Enjoy the class three boogie and eddy out in the pool on the left formed by bedrock above the horizon line. #1 is a sweet autoboof best run with a hard left to right. #2 a gorgeous and juicy late boof. #3 changes a lot based on the lake level from a manky staircase to a clean auto boof to nothing at all. Paddle out the lake and get out at the beautiful campsite on the left. Enjoy some takeout beers on the beach while someone else runs shuttle. Pretend you and your crew are from bomb flow in 2012 and take some artistic shots on the beach or trade lines from the Iconic cold open of \u00ab the bc episode \u00bb. Make up some excuse about why you don\u2019t wanna rip another 20k down the road to Fosthall Creek to rappel in to Twin Falls and call er a day.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Optional waterfall at the start.\nClass\nIII at low levels, IV when the water is high.\nScouting / Portaging\nVaried - some of the river is in a deep canyon.  Wood is often a problem.\nTime\n1-2 hours.\nWhen to Go\nAfter heavy rain, usually in the fall/winter.\nLynn Creek sits squarely in both location and difficulty between the two other popular North Vancouver rivers - the Capilano and the Seymour Canyon. The Lynn is a small drainage with crystal clear water, fun rapids that cater to a wide range of boaters and even an optional waterfall at the put in to fire up. It is surprisingly high quality urban class III-IV fun.\nA map of North Vancouver is all you need to find the Lynn. The take out is at Bridgeman Park just south of the Keith Road bridge. The put in is at Lynn Canyon Park. Being in an urban area there are many routes between the two. Get to the water by following the signs for the Twin Falls bridge found at the south (downstream) end of the park. It is a 5-10 minute walk from the parking lot to the water. Above Twin Falls is a serious section of whitewater of dubious runnability.\nThe Lynn has a visual staff gauge found at the take out bolted to a tree growing out of the river bed.\u00a0 The visual gauge has two parts: upper and lower colored gauges with green, orange and red bands.\u00a0 Lower green is bare minimum and good for low water runs of Twin Falls.\u00a0 Lower orange has a nice class III feel and lower red means the rocks are fewer and it is maybe no longer appropriate for intermediate or tentative boaters.\u00a0 You can run the river all the way up to the top of the gauge and beyond, but once you get into the orange marker on the upper gauge it's getting high and while not crazy difficult everything is moving very fast and being able to stop in the event of a swim or because of wood is a real issue to consider.\u00a0 On the Lynn, appropriate water levels will vary greatly with who is here to paddle.\nBecause the Lynn is a small drainage it flashes up and down quickly, and it needs a lot of rain to get going. Typically the Cap and Seymour are high or too high when the Lynn runs. It has a propensity to collect wood so be vigilant, especially if you're going in at higher levels.\nTwin Falls is the optional put in waterfall - it's found under the Twin Falls bridge. It's an intimidating drop that is usually run at lower levels with a bad rapid in the immediate run out. To run the falls seal launch in above it, otherwise the trail continues downstream on river left to an easy put in below the falls.\nBelow the falls are some open rapids. The canyon starts at the first sharp bend to the right with some fun warm up drops. Some of the rapids are difficult to portage, but you can almost always bail out up to a hiking trail on river left.\u00a0 The end of the canyon comes after a short but noticeable narrowing of the canyon walls.\nBelow the canyon are a few kms of open gravel bed rapids to the take out. Take out on the right immediately after passing under the highway 1 and Keith Road bridges where it is just a short walk up to the cars. The gauge is found here at the take out. Enjoy!\nTwin Falls at a juicy flow (lower red on the gauge).\nSky High - one of the big rapids.\nThe narrow canyon near the end of the run.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Needs a good amount of rain.\nHidden way out there on Vancouver Island, the Mahatta River has a short quality canyon that would get paddled regularly if it wasn't at the end of the world. Although the area is heavily logged, the river corridor retains a wild west coast feel right down into the Pacific Ocean. The adventure experience is capped off by paddling back up Quatsino Sound to the takeout. To make it out to this remote area, you are either on a hardcore creeking mission, or on a trip to the nearby beaches.\nFlows\nThe Mahatta is a fairly low elevation watershed, and it is doubtful that there is any snowmelt season. A good west coast rain should get this going; for comparison, it is in a similar climatic zone as the Sarita River near Bamfield. There is no gauge on the Mahatta, but there is on the adjacent Klaskish River (KLASKISH RIVER NEAR KLASKINO INLET (08HE009)). A 20-30mm rain and the Klaskish gauge dropping off a 50cms spike resulted in a medium-high level on the Mahatta River. These rivers will flash up and down quickly.\nKLASKISH RIVER NEAR KLASKINO INLET (08HE009), 2018 gauge data and maximum flows. You'll have to catch one of these rain spikes to run the Mahatta.\nShuttle\nThe downside is that this river is way out there, 1.5 hours on a rough road past Port Alice, which is 4.5 hours drive from the Nanaimo ferry terminal. The upside is that with the orientation of the river and the ocean paddle, you don't really need a shuttle car. To find the put in, use your map to follow Marine Drive south out of Port Alice (road radio recommended). The route will wrap around Neroutsos Inlet, climb up a pass in the Teeta Creek drainage (T500 road), and drop into the Mahatta area. There are put in options at the Mahatta River Recreation Site or a nearby FSR bridge. The takeout is a further 4km to the right (north) down the Mahatta FSR, at a logging landing on the ocean.\nOn the water\nBeginning at the Mahatta River Recreation Site, there is ~7km of class I-II, including one easy canyon and probably a logjam or two. The whitewater section is only ~2km long. The start of the gradient is obvious, at the first of two class IV rapids which ramp into 90 degree corners. Following these are two rapids with ledge holes. Below here, the river canyons up noticeably for the crux rapid (class V), which is scouted on the right. This one is worth a scout, as half the river flows through a sieve. There are informal trails to portage on river right. Finally, there is one more clean ledge dropping down to tidewater and the estuary. Turn right (east), and follow the coast ~6km through the Koskimo Islands (sea otter zone), past a fish farm, and across to the takeout at the Mahatta logging landing.\nDriving over the Teeta pass in April.\nOne possible put in.\nOne of the early ramp rapids.\nA ledge hole.\nMahatta River boogie.\nThe crux rapid.

Flow is negatively impacted by a power project and needs high water to be possible.\nGauge\n16.6cms\u2191 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nAccess to Mamquam Falls is under direct threat by the proposed development of a tourist attraction that plans to create an elevated walkway through the canyon and above the falls. It is possible that physical access could be blocked by the walkway, and liability concerns might prevent paddlers from accessing the river across the development's tenure. Considering just how unique Mamquam Falls is as a large, runnable waterfall (a global rarity), the large negative cumulative effect that development (in particular IPPs) has had on access and flow for rivers in British Columbia and the fact that the Mamquam is already severely impacted by dewatering for a power project, any additional development that will further restrict the ability to run this waterfall is not a preferred outcome.\nMamquam Falls is a waterfall located on the Mamquam River, just outside of Squamish. Renowned for its large size, runnability and pleasing aesthetic, Mamquam Falls is only one of a few waterfalls in the world that is sought out year after year by cutting edge international athletes to test their mettle, and it is a major draw attracting paddlers to the Sea to Sky zone. Also well known to local kayakers looking to push their limits, Mamquam Falls is an incredible river feature that must be seen to believe, even if you just scout it out and set safety for your friends.\nThe falls is located on the Mamquam River on the south side of Squamish. You can get there by following the Mamquam FSR (off highway 99) for about 3 km, driving along under the Chief. At a large intersection, turn left down Powerhouse Road and follow until you reach a gate. The gate may or may not be open, but it's only another 100 m to a bridge over the Mamquam. To minimize the risk of getting locked in it might be best to park on the outside of the gate even if it is open. The falls is directly under the bridge. Access is obvious, but please be aware the power company (there is a generating station for an IPP at the base of the falls) do not want you trespassing on their property.\nFlow on the Mamquam is a problem due to the fact that it is dewatered for a power project. It's too low to run unless water is spilling over the dam upstream, which is usually during times of peak snowmelt in early summer and after rains all year. As the safe window for navigation is relatively small, it's hard to time the flow window correctly because the flow is often rising or falling quickly. On top of that, there's no online gauge so you'll just have to go look at it to know when it's good.\nMamquam Falls is about 60-70 feet tall, a big but not unreasonably large size. Aside from the dangers associated with running any big waterfall, the main issue with Mamquam is a dangerous cave in the pool on river right. Just scout carefully and set safety, and all will be good. If you're there to run Mamquam Falls proper, it's also worth your while to wander a few hundred meters upstream when you put on. You'll find and often overlooked but awesome 20-30 foot waterfall there as a warm up. Enjoy - this is a pretty special place!\nTaking it all in at the lip of Mamquam Falls.

The last two kilometres known as the Middle Mamquam is class IV, but please see the dam warning.\nClass\nIII-IV\nScouting / Portaging\nMore or less roadside\nTime\n2-3 hours\nWhen to Go\nEarly summer or after rainfall. The last 2km can be run year-round.\nGauge\n16.6cms\u2191 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nSAFETY ADVISORY UPDATE JULY 2025 - DAM OPEN JULY 24TH 2025 to September?\nThe take-out of this section either ends at the Bridge, or if continuing down please consider the next section closed currently and only for advanced paddlers in the future.\nPlease inspect the take-out before running this.\nThe head-pool of the dam can be opened at any time, in October 2023 a group paddled down this section, discovered the head-pool was gone and instead there was a continuous rapid into a deadly dam and waterfall. They managed to take out at the last second but it was a big surprise for them and it was only because they were familiar with the run that they realised something was different and were in danger.\nPlease inspect the take-out before paddling, S2SES have notified us the Dam will be open from July 24th 2025 for a few weeks and as such we cannot recommend anyone paddles below the bridge at this time\nThe Dam opens annually to drain silt and this will coincide with medium/high water, we are working on getting a notification system in place to know when this is happening. As well as this it could be open due to malfunction or emergency so consider this river to have a MUST-MAKE-TAKEOUT and make sure all paddlers are capable of making such eddies.\nWe have identified a new take-out further up-stream, from there you can just about see the dam sign but it's still not obvious, especially with late afternoon sun in your eyes.\nVIDEO OF HEAD POOL WHEN DAM IS OPEN!\nThis is looking downstream the head-pool with the dam open at Very Low Water.\nIn the above photo, the river is normally a big flat pool at this point, there is a sign on river left and a rope strung above the water level to indicate to not proceed any further downstream.\u00a0 At high water with the dam open taking out here is very tricky, take out further up-stream.\nSame spot as above, but with the dam closed. (spot the yellow sign lower left in both pics)\nThis following photo is with the dam closed and the head-pool present. With significant flow even with the dam closed it's still dangerous as water will flow down river right over a spillway into an un-runnable waterfall.\u00a0 The yellow sign bottom left is the 'official take out' by a string over the river.\nThe Upper Mamquam is a classic III+ run near Squamish. It's best run at higher flows -- peak snowmelt or after rain.\nTo get to the river, drive up the Mamquam FSR from Highway 99. About 11m from the highway (after you cross Raffuse Creek and near a brand new -- 2020 -- clearcut), you'll see a gate on the left leading to the Upper Mamquam Hydro Project. This is the lowest takeout. 2km up from here, take a left over a bridge across the Mamquam. If you're looking to skip the class IV section, you can take out here. Continue on this road across Skookum Creek and stay right at all upcoming intersections. The final spur road (another 9km up from Skookum Creek) has some deep water bars, but it's a short walk to the put-in from there if your vehicle can't make it.\nIt is also possible to carry on further up on a recently improved road and add on another 5-10km of paddling, apparently further up-stream there is a good waterfall too.\u00a0 The last section before the usual put-on for this section is slightly tighter and should be considered class IV.\nThe put-in -- the remnants of an old bridge.\nThe river starts out small but gains flow after the Crawford Creek confluence. There are a few rapids right at the put-in, but it quickly flattens out for a handful of kilometres. The Mamquam goes through a short \"canyon\" section with a series of class III+ rapids before opening back up. Watch out for trees in the more open, mellow sections.\nA beautiful waterfall on a tributary (river-right).\nEventually, you reach the Skookum Creek confluence and the river picks up a substantial amount of volume. From here down, the rapids build to class IV before all-too-quickly going flat above the takeout dam, take out well above the dam, there is a warning sign as a designated take-out but 100m there is some red flagging tape on river left around an old tree stump which is where route is flagged which will take you up to the road. Use caution as if the head pool is low or if the dam is open there isn't much of an eddy to use, inspect before paddling!\nYou can run this section from the bridge to dam at any water level; at low, late-summer flows, it's fun III+. When the normal Upper Mamquam is runnable, this section has a big water feel to it.\nFlows\nThe Mamquam gauge is newly online so we have yet to establish a solid correlation. 45-55cms translates to a nice low or medium-low level (though note that this still has a big volume feel for the last two kilometres). The gauge is quite far downstream (near town), so the correlation may not be consistent.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

It's runnable almost year round, although moderate levels during winter or late spring are probably most enjoyable. The river is mostly a class II-III float with optional class V rapids, and finishes off in the estuary and a paddle across Rupert Inlet. Despite starting at the highway, this river does not get paddled much, so be prepared for an adventure. Other rivers in the zone are the Benson and Link Rivers.\nFlows\nThe Marble River has several large lakes which should regulate flow throughout the winter and spring, perhaps similar to the Cowichan River system. However, the class V drops on the Marble are going to be more runnable at low to medium levels in dry periods between rain events. During high water winter rains the class V rapids may get unreasonably high. The sweet spot to run all of the class V drops at a reasonable level might be in the late spring (May, June). The river is possibly runnable into the summer if you want to explore ELF boating like on the Cowichan. Recommended flows are between 20-50cms, on the Environment Canada gauge Marble River at outlet of Alice Lake.\nMARBLE RIVER AT OUTLET OF ALICE LAKE (08HE001).

Recommended flows are 20-50cms.\nShuttle\nTo get to the put in, take the north island highway past Port McNeill, turn west on Highway 30 (The Frigon Road) towards Port Alice and a bridge over the river at Marble River Provincial Park. The closest take out option is at the Varney log dump on Rupert Inlet, found by doubling back on the highway, turning left (north) onto the Port Hardy Main, and left again (west) onto the Varney Main. It's also possible to take out at Coal Harbour or the head of Rupert Inlet. Another option would be to paddle half the run to Bear Falls, then hike back to the put in on the river left trail.\nOn the water\nThe river alternates between class II sections and portageable class V drops. All of the big rapids can be scouted at portaged on river left, sometimes by going up and into the open forest. At winter flows, class III skills are recommended to catch eddies in swift water above class V drops. At low flows in the late spring or summer, the river is reported to have a more pool drop character and class II skills may be adequate.\nThe first rapid visible from the highway, Lake Outlet Falls (V), is a technical slide with a few big holes. Most people will put on below, in the campground. After a section of class II, the first canyon appears. A lead in rapid flows right into a couple drops in the IV-V range. After a short open section, Bear Falls (V) is a riverwide 4m ledge, which is not very clean since it was blasted for fisheries purposes. After more class II, the second canyon starts abruptly at Twin Falls (V). At winter flows, this is a boxed in set of violent ledge holes. Presumably these get more runnable with less water. The rest of the second canyon is beautiful flatwater in a deep canyon, with a couple class II-III rapids with avoidable undercuts. After a long intertidal zone through the estuary, it is another 5-10km paddle across the inlet to whichever takeout you selected. Quatsino Narrows is nearby and has tidal exchanges up to 8 knots.\nAt high tide, it's possible to paddle flatwater upstream from the inlet into the scenic lower canyon.\nThe view from Highway 30 down into Lake Outlet Falls.\nAerial view looking back up at Lake Outlet Falls (V).

The takeout is 16km north of Jade City along Highway 37 (AKA 11km downstream from the put in), at the confluence with a small creek marked either as 1st North Fork Creek or Centreville Creek, where the highway approaches within 50m of the river.\nIf you want to do some exploring, it definitely looks possible to put in higher or take out lower, but there are some private cabins and placer mining operations to consider when looking for access.\nOn the water\nPutting on Allan Lake is a scenic start with great views of the Cassiar Mountains. The whitewater is not much to write home about, mostly continuous bouncy class II-III with several blind corners and no standout rapids. Keep an eye out for hazards related to placer mining (e.g. cables, old bridges, etc). There are some small cliff banks here and there, but the river never really canyons up. In 2022, this run did not require any wood or debris portages.

With easy access to the put in, and presumed easy access to a takeout, (located a few km of flatwater downstream of where the 2 groups *known* to have done the run took out) the McGregor is well worth doing.\n*quite possibly someone has done run it that I don't know about*\nClassic big water canyon style rapids, only 1 mandatory portage which is easy at river level, beautiful dark canyon walls, far enough out there to feel like a real adventure. This would make a great warm up run for anyone on their way north for some multi-days.\nThis canyon would never get too low to kayak and seems like it would still go with quite high water. ~225 cms felt like big water, however, despite being in a fairly tight canyon, it didn't look like anything would become unrunnable or unportageable with more water.\nLogjam!\nSo much easier than going up into the woods!\nLawrence finishing off the portage\nClassic McGregor Canyon\nSome nice \"in between\" whitewater.

The 1st decent in 2005 took out by hiking about 3 km on an overgrown logging road.15 years later the overgrown logging road was either alders, swamp or a delightful combination of the 2.\nOpt for the flatwater rather than the bushwack. Putting in at the bridge and taking out when the road on river left gets close to the river will add a good few kilometres of flatwater, but will be vastly better than the \"B.C. Hellf***\" encountered on the bushwack. (I have not actually driven up the river left takeout road, but the satellite images make it look passable by vehicle at least up to a point close to the river, although there might be washouts/deactivations blocking the last 3km of good road before the river)\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Meager, ripped down Capricorn Creek, and buried much of the Meager and upper Lillooet valleys in debris. Several bridges were destroyed, and a lake formed temporarily behind the debris dam, potentially threatening Pemberton. Fortunately, Meager Creek established a new riverbed, and once new logging access was built on river right, it wasn't long before kayakers came to have a look. Although seeing the landslide in person may be the most interesting part of the trip, the whitewater is actually a pretty fun continuous section that is possibly worth the sweaty hike in. Meager Creek Hotsprings are just a short hike further upstream from the put in.\nA proxy gauge is LILLOOET RIVER NEAR PEMBERTON (08MG005), and a flow of 200cms on that gauge in July was a nice padded medium on Meager Creek, which contributes only an estimated 10-20% to that flow. Flows can peak higher during very hot weather and heavy rain, but this is when the landslide risk is greatest and visiting is not advised. The BC government has a protocol for shutting down the area during these high risk windows.\n2020 hydrograph and median for LILLOOET RIVER NEAR PEMBERTON (08MG005).\nMeager Creek is an hour drive northwest of Pemberton. The best access is on the Lillooet South FSR to the gate at ~24km. The gate is a short bushwhack from a take out at the confluence of Perkins Creek and the Lillooet River. To get to the put in, hike a further ~6km up the FSR. There is about 300m of vertical gain, and the best put in is where the road drops back down to river level. An alternate takeout option is located on the Lillooet River FSR across from the Meager confluence, but using this option is unlikely to save any time because of the ferrying and bushwhacking involved.\nThe river is very continuous class 4(+) boulders with very few eddies, at least in the first portion, and is similar to but a bit easier than the Lower Ryan. The entire run can be scouted on the hike in, but from ~100m above river level, leaving it hard to judge the true size of river features. Multiple groups have put on expecting full on class V, only to find manageable class IV. But, it is entirely possible the opposite could happen at a higher flow. Also, it is certain that the river morphology, gradient, and difficulty will evolve over time.\nPart of the crux section where Meager Creek cuts through the debris dam left by the Capricorn Creek landslide.\nMeager and Capricorn Creeks\nThere's plenty of time on the hike in to argue about how big the whitewater is.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The run starts with a downhill bushwhack into the small Middle Memekay River and finishes at major FSR bridge over the Memekay River. Both rivers have very scenic canyons with a lot of corners, which often contain riverwide wood (hopefully duckable). The combined experience is a little like running Lynn Creek into the Capilano River, if that were possible. Even though the surrounding area has been heavily logged, the forest in the river corridor is mostly intact old growth. As long as you can catch it with enough water this is a great run, and don't forget to check out the other Sayward highlights while you're in the area: White (III-V) and Adam (III+). Check out more details on these runs and others in an upcoming guidebook produced by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nThe Middle Memekay River is fairly small, and levels rapidly flash up and down. Since the gauges are downstream, by the time online flow readings are falling, the Middle Memekay could already be dropping out. The run will only hold water for the day it is raining, the day after, and maybe two days from a really big rain. To target a low-medium flow, try for 150cms on the SALMON RIVER NEAR SAYWARD (08HD006), or 50cms on the SALMON RIVER ABOVE MEMEKAY RIVER (08HD007). The actual flow in the Middle Memekay is only a small fraction of these values. Expert kayakers will enjoy this river at double these flows, but the run will be harder than class III-IV. In the spring, you'll need less water on the online gauge, as more water comes from snowmelt high in the drainage. However, snowmelt is rarely adequate for enjoyable flows without additional rain, and a springtime level of 50cms at Sayward was brutally low. Visual levels at the put in and take out can be hard to judge, but you don't want it too look scrapey, especially at the takeout.\n2020 hydrograph and median flows for SALMON RIVER NEAR SAYWARD (08HD006). To target a low-medium flow aim for 150cms on this gauge, less in spring.\nThe run is less than an hour north of Campbell River on Highway 19 and logging roads, but finding it will be a struggle without a map (e.g. Backroads Mapbook). The takeout is located where the Salmon River Main crosses the Memekay River, near the Memekay Horse Camp Recreation Site. To get to the put in, head east (on river right) and make a series of right turns onto Big Tree Main, Memekay Main, and Memekay West Main to park at branch W300 near a corner at the top of a hill. You will have crossed the upper Memekay River enroute, which doesn't look that great for paddling. Walk northwest down the overgrown W300 for ~400m until there is old growth forest on your right, before the road starts climbing again. If you pick the right spot to enter the bush, there will be a walkable forested spur right down to water level, with steep gullies to the sides.\nThe Middle Memekay River starts with a couple boulder gardens, but is mostly narrow twisting class III+ canyons which can contain wood. Once you pass a bedrock island, get ready to scout and/or portage the crux class IV rapid. After the confluence, the Memekay River is a bit easier class III but with slightly bigger canyons.\nLooking upstream at the put in for the Middle Memekay at a brutally low flow of 50cms on the SALMON RIVER NEAR SAYWARD (08HD006) gauge.

Although the steeper whitewater is reportedly not good, the lower reaches are runnable in a packraft. Even though everything can be portaged, a minimum of class III skills is required to catch eddies above unrunnable rapids and avoid numerous logjams. Expect to spend two days bushwhacking and portaging to enjoy one day of floating out, through a beautiful old growth forest down to a pristine estuary.\nFlows\nLook for the Gold (GOLD RIVER BELOW UCONA RIVER (08HC001)) to be around 100cms off snowmelt for a medium low kayaking level on the Moyeha, which can usually be found during spring snowmelt in May or June, depending on the snow year. 50cms on the Gold should be adequate for packrafting.\nShuttle\nThe shuttle is 5 hours each way, so you are going to want to find a shuttle driver or two. Start the hike at Jim Mitchell Lake, just beyond the Bedwell Lakes trailhead in Strathcona Provincial Park, found past the south end of Buttle Lake by branching off BC Highway 28 NW of Campbell River. Takeout is by chartered water taxi from the Moyeha River mouth to Tofino, at the terminus of BC Highway 4.\nHike In\nFrom Jim Mitchell Lake at 650m elevation, route find up to one of several passes into the Moyeha drainage, topping out at 900-1000m elevation in the subalpine. The steep south facing descent will meet the river at 350-400m elevation. It's pretty likely you will have to keep hiking downstream along the small braided stream to a large pond at 250m elevation, before considering paddling much. The bushwhack in generally takes 16 hours of travel time to cover ~10km of route distance.\nPaddle out\nFrom the pond at 250m elevation, the Moyeha drops into a steep section formed by landslides and huge rockfall boulders. A kayaking trip reported this section to be class IV-V with several portages, not very clean whitewater, and lots of wood. A game trail starts on the river right side of the pond, beginning a big portage of 1-2km, but good luck following it. Rejoin the river wherever you feel comfortable with the decreasing gradient. Eventually, this section tapers off from class V all the way down to class II gravel bars. But wait, there's more: a few bedrock ledges that are not good to go, but can be portaged at river level. From the confluence of Kowus Creek down to the estuary is beautiful class I-II.\nPaddling across Thelwood Lake\nDropping off the pass into the Moyeha watershed\nThe steep descent into the Moyeha rainforest\nCliff bands on one potential descent route (photo Daphnee Tuzlak)\nFinally on the Moyeha, above the pond.\nThe pond\nThe character of the steep parts of the Moyeha River (photo Daphnee Tuzlak)\nPortaging around the steep stuff in the forest\nSome say they are still portaging to this day\nPartway down the big landslide/rockfall rapid at low water.\nPutting back on the river as the gradient tapers off below the landslide section (photo Heather Buckingham)\nMoyeha magic\nMoyeha misery (photo Heather Buckingham)\nThe bedrock ledges towards the end are not made for kayaking (photo Daphnee Tuzlak)\nA rare runnable bedrock rapid (photo Heather Buckingham)\nKowus Creek (left) and Moyeha River (right), Gold gauge at 32cms.\nLower Moyeha River.\nLower Moyeha River.\nThe estuary at Clayquot Sound.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The levels posted on the sign by the road are not always up-to-date. To get first hand information, walk down to the resort and check the stick gauge on a cliff just upstream of the raft take-out. Low: 1.7 (this is off the gauge in its present state), Medium: 2.2, High: 2.7. Not sure what the correlation to the online gauge is.\nScenery\n: Moderate use by kayakers, lots of commercial rafting. Dry forest, excellent camping by the river, a beautiful spot to spend a weekend.\nLength of Run\n: 8 km\nLength of Shuttle (one way)\n: 8 km\nSpecial Considerations\n: Watch for log jams and big holes.\nDirections\n: From Hope take Hwy 1 (Fraser Canyon) to Boston Bar. Turn left (west) before the Husky station onto Chaumox Rd. Continue to the bridge over the Fraser and zero your odometer. Following the signs to Reo Rafting Resort, take the left fork at 10.3 km and right at 13.1 km. At 14.7 km the road crosses the Nahatlach River. A side road at 15.4 km leads to the river left Canyon take-out. Pass the entrance to Reo at 16 km and continue to Apocynum CG at 17.7 km. This is the take-out for the upper run. It is possible to scout some of the bigger rapids on the drive to the put-in. \u201cTwisted Sisters\u201d is 500 m upstream of a pull-out at 21.6 km (20 km sign). Downstream from 23.6 km (22 km sign) the \u201cHeadwall\u201d drop can be seen. At 24.6 km (23 km sign) \u201cMeatgrinder\u201d and \u201cRose Garden\u201d can be scouted from the top of a cliff above the river. If you don\u2019t like what you see, drive back downstream 0.6 km to a driveway blocked by a cable and put in here. The normal put-in is at Frances Lake - 25.7 km on the odometer. Park out of the way \u2013 the rafting companies use this area to turn around their bus and trailer.\nDescription\n: Use the lake for a warm-up, there isn\u2019t much time before you get to \u201cRose Garden\u201d, a long and busy class III (IV-). Depending on water level it is either a hole garden or boulder garden. \u201cMeatgrinder\u201d (IV) is immediately below where the river makes a right turn. This rapid can be scouted from the left or right, but portaging is only recommended on the right side. The river descends over several steps through ledge holes and boulders until it drops into \u201cMeatgrinder\u201d, a big hole that extends from the left bank to the middle of the river. A possible line is to start on the left and move right above the hole. One kilometer below is \u201cHeadwall\u201d (III+/IV-) recognizable by a tall cliff the river seems to run into. 2 km later, after a few easier drops the river makes a left turn into \u201cTwisted Sisters\u201d with two big pour-over holes on the middle-left. The following drops are easier but there are still plenty of holes to catch the unsuspecting boater.\nCamping, Food and Non-paddling Activities: There are plenty of forest service campgrounds along the river. Fill up with everything you need in Boston Bar since there are no services once you are at the Nahatlach River. For apr\u00e8s paddling, check out the canyon on a short trail starting at the Reo Resort. Explore Nahatlach Lakes or one of the many back roads. Some of them lead to the edge of the alpine for great views and excellent hiking. Inquire about road conditions beforehand \u2013 4WD may be required.\nApocynum cannabinum (Dogbane or Indian hemp) is an herbaceous plant that is used as a source of fibers by Native Americans. It is poisonous and its milky latex can cause blisters.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Earlier for high water runs.\nGauge\n11.5cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:10)\n!\nThe Nahatlatch River is one of the many rivers that flow into the west side of the Fraser River in the Fraser Canyon. In contrast to most of these rivers it's a well-known kayaking and rafting run. Draining the east side of the Coast Mountains, this river flows well into the summer. As levels start to drop from raging high water the lower Canyon section comes into runnable flows, revealing a fun stretch of class IV nestled down in a small canyon. Come for the rapids and stay for the good camping, clear water and nice weather.\nWater levels on the Nahatlatch can be measured visually or\nonline\n. In a normal year June will be high water falling to low levels by mid/late August. This river has a broad range of boatable flows and it is runnable at very high water if you're up for it. Unfortunately the staff gauge system is complicated, and we aren't familiar with what the online levels mean. The class III-IV focused Vancouver Whitewater Club seem to prefer the 40-80 cms range. It should be doable at lower and much higher water levels.\nAccess to the Nahatlatch Canyon is along forest service roads and spur roads that are in good condition. In Boston Bar, cross to the west side of the Fraser River and head north on the Nahatlatch River FSR, following the signs for Reo Rafting. You will eventually drive over a bridge that passes over the heart of the canyon. About 500 m upstream is a spur road off to the right - follow this road down the hill, turning right at the split. This leads to a clearing and an old bridge footing - the take out. To reach the put in return to the main road and continue upstream past Reo to the Apocynum Campsite - put in here.\nFrom the Apocynum to Reo is undefined class II-III. At the obvious raft access at Reo Rafting you'll find the staff gauge to check the level. Immediately below Reo is the start of the canyon - for the most part everything is easily scouted and portaging is possible. The two biggest rapids present themselves as recognizable horizon lines and are easy to scout via the river left trail - these rapids come near the start. Take out shortly after passing under the road bridge. There is one more rapid just above the Fraser if you're motivated to go further.\nThe Nathatlach Canyon is short but quite fun - after your first run you should be able to bomb it quickly, and with the short shuttle it's a great section of river to run laps on - have fun!\nDown the middle at The Nozzle, the Canyon's biggest rapid\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

      "full_text": "BCWhitewater\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nAbout\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact\nBecome a member\nNass River\nWhat It's Like\nEverything from a 5-6 day wilderness trip to a big water play run.\nClass\nIII-V\nScouting / Portaging\nAll rapids can be scouted/portaged, except for Moose Carcass Canyon where it is hard to stop.\nTime\n1-9 days, depending on the combination of sections.\nGauge\n600.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:10)\n!\nContributed by Ali Marshall\nThe Nass is born on the Spatsizi Plateau, in the interior of Northern BC. Sometimes called 'The Sacred Headwaters', this pristine wilderness is the source of the Northwest's three greatest salmon rivers: the Stikine, the Nass and the Skeena. It flows for 380km through Tahltan and Nisga'a territory before reaching the Pacific. Unlike the Stikine, the Nass has a very even gradient with 6-7+ days of whitewater.\nFlow Windows\nThe Upper Nass should be paddled at the tail end of the spring freshet. If you're an experienced kayaker, high water is recommended (June/July rather than August/September). The online gauge is located near the take out of the Lower section and it does not give an accurate representation of flows on the Upper. The Upper can be paddled at low water but the quality of the rapids decreases. There is no official cut off for the Middle Nass. Above 1800cms there are some LARGE whirlpools and swims are not recommended. This section doesn't get too low. It's not recommended to paddle the Lower Nass over 1800cms. The river pushes through some constrictions, generating large boils and whirlpools at high water.\nUpper Nass\nFly In\nDrive to Tatogga Lake on Highway 37, 386 km north of Kitwanga Junction.\nAlpine Lakes Air\nfly into Nass Lake (the source).\nHike In\nDrive North on Hwy 37. 1.6 km past Tatogga Lake Lodge, take a right onto Ealue Lake Rd. Drive roughly 25 km down the dirt road until you reach the bridge over the Klappan River. Hang a right onto the old railway grade. Drive roughly 90 km down the railway grade until you reach the second airstrip followed by a large 180 degree bend to the left (see attached map). Park at the culverts passing under the road.\nThis road is prone to wash out. If in doubt, contact the Tahltan Band office for current conditions. It helps to say that you are not a hunting party.\nHike southwest up the creek, follow the second small tributary that enters from the river left. Follow until creek dries out. Continue southwest across the plateau. The horizon dips to the right and left. Both lead to tributaries that eventually flow into the Klappan. Follow your nose and eventually you will end up at the river. The Klappan has some class 3 and 4 rapids. Paddle for roughly 4 km until a large marsh appears on the left. Hike across the marsh/grassland on a southeast heading. In 4 km you will reach Nass Lake.\nTake Out\nPark at the Meziadin Hwy bridge rest area. Hike your boats up and out of the river. Or 4.2 km south of the bridge, by Elsworth Culvert, there is a small turn off that provides truck access down to the river. It can also be used as a put in for the middle and lower sections. This access point is unmaintained and may be in poor condition.\nDescription\nLeaving Nass lake, the river slowly meanders for 6 km until a few tributaries bump up the flow. It's not uncommon for crews to drag this section during low water. 10 km downstream, the whitewater begins. For the first few days, the rapids are ledge drop in nature. The largest can be found on day three. A powerful approach with a 15 ft falls at the bottom. Scout or portage on river left. On day 4, you will come across two of the biggest log jams you have ever seen, just a few hundred meters apart from one another. If the logs are dry, portage straight over the top. If wet and slippery, the safest option is to portage both on river right. Downstream from the log jams, down to the Bell Irving River confluence, is some fantastic big volume class 3-4. Keep an eye out for transmission lines crossing the river. Under them is a large rapid that gets powerful at high water. Scout on river left.\nTake out at the highway bridge or continue down to enjoy the middle and lower sections.\nThis is an extremely remote section of river. Be prepared. Hiking out for much of the run is not an option. Bug and bear spay is a good idea.\nMiddle Nass (Day/Play Run)\nPut In\nThere are several access points for putting on this section.\n1: Park in the rest area at the Meziadin Hwy bridge and scramble down to the river. The bridge is 137 km north of Kitwanga Junction on Hwy 37.\n2: 4.2 km south of the Hwy bridge, by the Elsworth Culvert, is truck access to the river. The road is unmaintained. This is the most convenient put in, but you miss the first rapid.\n3: Heading north, take the first left after the Meziadin Hwy bridge. Drive through what looks like a gravel pit, keep going straight. You will pass a fish ladder and Nisga'a fisheries. Park at the end of the road and paddle the Meziadin River into the Nass. Please act respectfully if use this access point.\nTake Out\n31 km south of the Meziadin Bridge, on the west side of the Hwy, is the Arbor FSR. Drive 1 km down this road until you reach the bridge. There is a trail that leads down to the Nass, river left of the bridge.\nDescription\nThis is a straightforward section to navigate. The whitewater is comprised of large standing waves and boils. Keep your eyes peeled for the occasional large hole and whirlpool.\nLower Nass\nPut In\nUse the take out of the Play section (bridge on the Arbor FSR) to access the Lower. Most people will put on upstream, paddling the Bell Irving River and Middle/Play section first. There is another bridge halfway down this section. Get to this Nass/Kitsault bridge from New Aiyanch. Drive through New Aiyanch towards Nass Camp on the Nass FSR. After 33 km turn north towards Kitsault, drive 14 km north along the Nass/Kinskuch FSR until you hit the bridge.\nTake Out\nTake out at the boat launch, near New Aiyansh on river left. To get to the boat launch from Terrace drive north up the Nisga'a Hwy. After driving through the lava fields the road hits a T junction. Hang a right towards New Aiyanch (Gitlaxt'aamiks). After you drive over the Tseax River bridge, continue for 6.5 km. Take a left onto Irene Meadows Rd. There is a 'No Thru Rd' sign. Follow for 4 km until you hit the river. Park so you are not in the way.\nDescription\nBelow the Arbour FSR bridge is a nice class 3+ canyon. After a few hours of flatwater the class 3+ Squish Rapid appears. Just below is the Nass/Kitsault bridge. Next is Moose Carcass Canyon, a class 3+/ 4 freight train with a couple of holes to dodge. The Tchitin river enters from river right, signaling the end of Moose Carcass. The river remains in a canyon but eases to class 2 for a couple of hours. When the river exits the canyon you have an hour or two of flatwater until you reach the boat launch / take out.\nMore Information\nMany groups choose to put on at the Bell Irving River to access the Nass. This adds an extra day of class 3-4 paddling upstream of the Meziadin Hwy Bridge/Middle Nass. To access this section drive 46 km north from the Meziadin bridge until you cross the Bell 1 Bridge.

Mainly class III-IV but one unportagable rapid is tricky and dangerous.\nScouting / Portaging\nUsually easy, however 2 rapids including the hardest can't be walked.\nTime\n2-4 hours.\nWhen to Go\nAfter rain or spring snowmelt.\nNorrish Creek is a great creek found little more than an hour east of Vancouver in the Fraser Valley near the town of Mission. Keeping with the theme of southwest BC, the Norrish contains a selection of clean-ish boulder rapids and some fine bedrock often squeezed between eerily tight vertical canyon walls. It's amazing how many cool zones are so close to such a big urban area.\nThe Norrish is generally of the class III-IV variety, at least at low to medium flows. However, the fact that two of the more notable rapids on this section are solidly class IV, and they are difficult if not impossible to portage can raise the stress level a little bit if class IV-IV+ is your max. Like all streams, this one packs more of a punch at higher levels and it isn't often run higher than 'medium' for the section because of a dangerously sticky river-wide hole in the unportageable rapid. Expect some fun boulder gardens with esthetically pleasing smooth rock and a handful of good bedrock rapids - while the road is never far away from the river, the canyon gets quite intimate in a few spots and the scenery here (with the exception of some rather unfortunately placed abandoned cars\nin\nthe river) is top notch, making the trip worthwhile for more than just the rapids.\nFinding good flows on the Norrish may present some issues - there is no reliable internet gauge. The best bet is to head to this one after a good rain happens in the lower mainland and hope for the best. There is a gauge at the takeout - it changes from time to time so try and get local beta on what currently represents high and low. Currently, 1.40m is medium (note that the locals refer to this as 4.0). Below 3.0 is low.\nFollow the map link to get to the river - the takeout is located about 15 minutes east of Mission. The road to the takeout is gated, so park a few hundred meters west of the bridge. The gauge is found on the downstream river left side of the road bridge. Put in about 7 km up the Norrish Creek FSR - look for an old road dropping towards the river that is not passable for normal vehicles. An upper put in is possible, but most accounts say the short section above the normal put in isn't really worth the effort.\nFrom the start you're treated with several nice bedrock ledges that give way to fun boulder garden rapids - for the most part this early section is not walled out like the lower reaches. As you get into a good grove you'll eventually notice a tilting of the river bed and the appearance of some more bedrock ledges and steeper boulder rapids that indicate the coming of the first unportageable rapid.\nThe first walled in section is easy to scout from the left - there is no good portage option. It has a notoriously sticky hole at the bottom - the line is obvious. This rapid is the high water limiting factor. Below this is some more action as you near the second of the walled out rapids.\nThis section is signified by a long straight stretch of river surrounded by canyon walls with an obvious pinch at the bottom - there are several large trees wedged in the walls 20 or 30 feet off the water. There is some wood here at water level that can usually be paddled around - if not you can execute a difficult portage along the left wall.\nThe river below this pinch lets up noticeably until the take out, with the exception of one rapid that is easy to spot from above. It is a fun class IV drop with a cool squeeze between two boulders at the bottom. This rapid is the end of the Norrish - the river valley opens up into some wide braided channels for a few kilometers that quickly bring you to the take out. Enjoy this Fraser Valley gem!\nThe rapid above the lower put in - sticky hole.\nClear green water on a beautiful March day.\nA great bedrock drop in the middle of the run.\nComing around the corner - this is the lead-in to the first must-run.  One of the coolest parts of it is paddling under the waterfall.\nThe end of the must-run.  This hole even at low water has a reputation for handing out significant beatings.\nChilling out in the canyon.\nComing in to the second walled in canyon.\nA wood problem that resulted in an annoying portage.\nThe view back up through the second canyon.\nMatt Kompass making quick work of the last rapid.  This rapid is now much different than in this photo.\nNorrish Creek gauge at the take out bridge.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Includes a pleasant paddle out on the main Stein.\nClass\nV+\nScouting / Portaging\nModerate.  Portaging in the steep section is easy compared to the approach.\nTime\n4-5 days, including the main Stein.\nWhen to Go\nJuly-August, depending on the snowpack.\nThe North Stein. The dirt bag route to access the main branch of the Stein. It could be the stoutest, steepest runnable mile of whitewater in the whole southwest BC/Coast Mountain zone. The North Stein was first discovered in the early 2000's by a team of local rippers, with the first descent happening in 2003. What was discovered was a short section of very steep and almost completely runnable gnar with difficult hike-in access. As an added bonus, running the North Stein leaves you just a few km downstream of Stein Lake on the main Stein, the start of one of the classic fly-in multiday runs in the area, leaving you with another 50 km of fun whitewater to paddle. This is a strenuous trip with huge whitewater that is far, far away from any roads. If you're not ready to go big way out in the wilderness and you still want to do the trip, it's an acceptable but challenging way to access the main Stein.\nThere is no gauge for either the North Stein or the Stein River, and it's basically impossible to get a visual level without hiking in to the creek. As such, one of the biggest challenges for a trip here is getting the flow right. While it should tolerate some variation in flows while remaining runnable it will definitely get too high and too low. In most years the best betting time should be in late July and early August, depending on the snowpack. This trip happened when the Stein was at a solid medium level, and when the Nahatlatch (as reported by REO Rafting) was running at approximately 2.2 on their gauge (also medium).\nTake out access is the same as that for a trip down the main\nStein\n. Park a car somewhere with public access to the Fraser River in or near Lytton. Accessing the river requires a lengthy drive and a long hike over difficult terrain with no trail. The 'trailhead' is located in the Van Horlick Creek valley; Van Horlick Creek flows in to the west end of Duffy Lake. From the Duffy Lake Road, the road up Van Horlick on river right is slightly overgrown, but it is in good enough shape to drive up in a 2wd with some clearance. When the road forks at about the 9 km mark, take the left branch. After another 2 km you will reach a second fork. This is essentially the end of the road as the left fork is overgrown to the point of not being passable, and the right fork is deactivated, with a bridge removed just 100 m from the fork. Unless you have a serious 4x4, this is the current trailhead.\nWithout a GPS, or even a map, the hike in is relatively straightforward. You can almost see the pass between Van Horlick and the North Stein drainage from the start of the hike. Our team decided to hike up the river left (not overgrown) road until it ended. From there you can descend a clear cut to the valley bottom where it is relatively easy going (considering there is no trail and you'll be carrying a kayak) to hike towards the pass. There is a prominent moraine at the head of the valley - climb the moraine towards the pass. Once the forest thins it's easier to walk in the open meadows, though the end of the moraine is only about half of the elevation gain. Upon gaining the pass you'll cross in to an open alpine valley and you'll be moving fast. Perhaps the worst part of the hike is the final 1 km descent (300 m elevation loss) down to the North Stein. At a moderate pace this hike takes about 8 hours.\nThe North Stein when you reach it is a very small creek, and it is absolutely infested with logs. It should take 2-4 hours to paddle the 10 km to the start of the good whitewater. It is tedious low volume 'paddling' with many, many portages around wood. The volume picks up as you get further along the river, and with the increasing volume the logs become less of a problem. There isn't a lot of good camping along the upper North Stein. If you want to have the best success in running the steep section of the river, you should arrange your schedule to spend a night as close to the steepness as you can. With an early start on the first day, most groups can reasonably complete the hike and a large portion of the paddle approach in 1 day, the hard section of the North Stein can be done in a day, and the main Stein will take 2 days for a total of 4 days. You could also take the relaxed route and do the hike/paddle in over 2 days instead of 1.\nThe goods on the North Stein start when you reach a slide. There's not much point in describing the whitewater. For how steep this run is, it's relatively easy to scout and portage. Take your time, run what you can and enjoy checking out this unique run. You'll find slides, stacked drops, rapids, wood, some mank and three really big drops/drop combos that will test even the best. There is a short run out between the last big rapids and the confluence with the main Stein.\nCheck out this link\nfor beta on the main Stein multiday. Groups coming off the North Stein can easily complete the Stein in 2 days - we recommend camping just below the cable car found a few km below the confluence on your first night on the Stein, and after the log jam portages in the flat water on your second night on the Stein. The trip ends on a high note with 15 km of awesome read and run whitewater between the flat water and the confluence of the Stein and the Fraser.\nUnfortunately LiquidLore doesn't have a lot of pictures of this run. In the absence of photos, check out the map of the area, and an excellent video of the North Stein from the 2011 season put together by Adrian Kiernan at White Box Magazine.\nView\nNorth Stein\nin a larger map\nGetting ready to hike at the end of the road - at least the end of the reasonable bit of road.\nThe sign indicating the main road is activated - not that it isn't obvious.\nBattling up the steep moraine headed for the pass.\nFighting to the end - beautiful wide open alpine scenery.\nCruising the alpine valley once you drop in to the North Stein drainage.\nOne of the first really good rapids in the steep section of the North Stein.

With crystal clear water and a classic mixture of Vancouver Island smooth bedrock and a bit of mank, this is perhaps one of the better moderate creek runs out there. On top of the nice waterfalls of Pamela this run actually ends on the Ucona River, which is packed full of even more bedrock canyons and falls that are sure to please.\nAccess to Pamela is along well maintained dirt logging roads. If you have never been here before, you will definitely need a backroads map book to find the put in and the take out. Follow the main road south out of Gold River, along the east side of the Gold River itself. It quickly turns to dirt. If you follow the main dirt road, it will first pass Star Lake (good camping), then it will cross the upper Ucona and finally it will cross the Pamela. There are no obvious landmarks to denote the take out road other than it is 4.5 km back towards town; it is fairly big spur road. Follow this road to the furthest downstream clear cut along the Ucona. Be sure go to the rivers edge and mark your take out as there is no easy way out of the next class V canyon downstream if you stray too far.\nPamela doesn't have a gauge, and as it's a small tributary of a tributary of the Gold River the gauge isn't always accurate. Furthermore, flow versus gauge reading will vary based on whether it is rain or snowmelt feeding the river. Levels tend to rise and fall quickly. This report is based on one visit where a flow of 90 cms snd falling after a rain event gave a low flow on Pamela, and another where 90 cms from snowmelt gave a medium level. Otherwise, the level is visual. What you see is what you get - if it is low but just floatable, the whole thing will be low but doable. If it looks high it`s probably pretty juicy. Use your best judgment.\nOn the water, the Pamela quickly picks up to fun ledges around the corner from the put in. Generally speaking, the action is well spaced on this run with good pools and recovery zones between everything that is of concern. The first waterfall sequence comes quickly and is best inspected from the right bank. There is a great deal of boogie-style whitewater between this drop and the Ucona confluence, with one more great section of bedrock mixed in. Unless the run is high there will be mank to deal with. Once on the Ucona the volume with at least double. You`ll find fun grade IV canyons and 2 excellent waterfalls. The take out is a short ways below another notable confluence (with the Quatchka) which is sometimes marked with flagging tape, or which you should recognize from scouting the take out.\nThe first bedrock falls on the Pamela.\nA random slot with a bit of a hole at the bottom.\nStacked Pamela action.\nThe first waterfall after you paddle out on to the Ucona.\nThe second drop - perhaps the best of the run - on the Ucona.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Above 100 its best to get out left before the canyon to scout. The upper canyon still goes but it does get pretty pushy at high water. At lower water run the boogie down into the canyon before getting out left after the first left turn. From here you can scout the first drop for wood. The left line is the easiest and involves a couple fun boofs. The right is pushier and more consequential. It offers one large boof and is generally favoured at lower water (below 30). The second drop can always be run by starting a boatlength off the right wall and driving right to late boof the hole. This move feels pretty hyphy/class 5 above 80 cumecs but the hole always flushes against the hole on the right.\nThe next section is about 2k of read and run class 3 with fun boofs and eddies to catch at any level. The river calms down a bit right before a creek comes in from river right. Eddy out by the mouth of this creek to scout\u00a0 Carl\u2019s. A nice portage and scouting path exists down the right side. Make your way through the fun boulder garden before boofing left or right around Carls hole at the bottom. Watch for logs stuck on the big rock at the bottom of the rapid. Enjoy fun class 2-3 boulder gardens to the takeout.\nLower:\nFour fun class 4 rapids typically paddled below 40 on the gauge. Begin with 1k of class 2 boulder gardens. At the first big left bend get out right to scout. There is a trail here that runs the whole canyon for photographers, bored partners and other shuttle bunnies (\u2764\ufe0f U Logan). This first rapid is called popcorn. Drive off the big autoboof (the popper) stay left and watch for the hole at the end. It gets sticky at high water. For the next drop ride the left wall and boof into the eddy or run off the autoboof in the centre. Be mindful of the sieve on the left after the eddy and make sure you are right of centre while exiting this drop. Firework is easily scouted, portaged or snuck on the left while centre and right lines can both be used to line up the right boof. The hole on the right flushes despite how violent it looks and responds well to the ohio tuck.\nTeenage dream: the last and most difficult run on this section. Scout from a micro eddy above the sieve river right. Beware that this eddy can disappear at high water. Run the hard left channel and make two sweet boofs before picking your way around the boulder in the narrowest point of the canyon. This big boulder is undercut and boasts a nasty pin spot on the upstream side. At low water it is easy to set safety on the right. Run the last 2 slides hard left before the canyon opens up and you enjoy the class 2 paddle back to your car. Don\u2019t forget to look back upstream and around you to enjoy the beautiful scenery in this gorgeous rainforest canyon.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Runnable flows are from around 5 to 25 CMS on the cranberry Creek gauge. At high water this run has countless midstream boofs and a good amount of catch on the fly surf waves. At low water the run channelizes quite well creating more eddies and a slower paced class 3/3+ feel with a few class 4/4+ rapids.\nThe river starts out with lots of continuous boulder garden rapids that stay consistent in difficulty and quality to what you see from the put in for at least half of the run. Eventually you get to a slightly harder rapid that can be boat scouted from the left eddy with a beautiful midstream boof. Another kilometer or so down there is a longer/harder rapid that can sneak up on you at high water. The hardest part of the run is marked by an obvious large logjam on river right with orange bouys stuck in it. From here down scouting and portaging on river right is recommended.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

One must portage canyon that can be dangerous.\nTime\n3-5 days for the full run\nWhen to Go\nLate summer & fall\nWhile the Pitt River is only a stones throw from Vancouver and Squamish, it has the feel of a remote river much further away. Starting in Garibaldi Provincial Park, the Upper Pitt is a challenging hike-in wilderness river suitable for Class IV and stronger paddlers with a solid set of wilderness skills looking for a remote wilderness trip. The gauge on this trip is tough, but it's likely best in late summer and early fall.\nAbove the Canyon - Class IV+ (P)\nThe upper reaches of the Pitt have been reached by hiking from either the Diamond Head or Rubble Creek trailheads. Hiking from Diamond Head the goal is to use the valley below the Bishop Glacier to access the river with a few options for getting there. From Rubble Creek, access is via a paddle across Garibaldi Lake and hiking over the passes behind it into the Pitt River headwaters. Every route has it's pluses and minuses, but this trip hasn't been done enough to definitively recommend one route over others.\nThe put-in\nThe locals.\nPretty standard view of the upper river.\nOnce on the river, be prepared for continuous, manky Class IV boating. The river is narrow and relatively shallow with a lot of rocks creating a seemingly endless stretch of drops, holes and marginal eddies. Portaging is usually possible at river level, and longer portages can be done by hiking up into mature forests and finding well worn game trails.\nAt around the 450m elevation band, the valley widens and the river eases to Class III/III+. But, the braiding brings significant log jams and increases the wood hazard, so keep your head up.\nLooking downstream at the canyon.\nEventually, the river starts to narrow again and pick up speed, marking the lead into a dangerous canyon. A strong team may be able to paddle this canyon, but for most people this will be a mandatory portage. Eddy out early to avoid a dangerous situation. Portaging can be done on either side of the river, but river left is preferable to avoid a challenging cliff band on river right.\nCanyon to Hot Springs - Class III+ (IV)\nBelow the canyon the river becomes fun Class III+ leading into a continuous stretch of whitewater near IceWorm Creek. The biggest drop on this stretch is the final rapid, a III+/IV drop beside a house sized rock where a massive hole forms river center. Can be portaged either side and is best run river right of the hole.\nPutting back in below the canyon crux.\nBelow the canyon/above Iceworm.\nBelow this stretch the river eases into II+/III before entering another constriction near the southern boundary of Garibaldi Park. In the summer of 2021 this constriction was blocked by a major river wide log jam portaged at river level. There is nothing technical in this section, but the combination of weird boils and wood requires attentive paddling.\nThe river again eases below, widening into classic coastal Class II boogie water. Keep an eye out for wood through this section leading into the hot spring canyon.\nThe hot spring canyon doesn't have any rapids in it, but in summer 2021 was blocked by a river wide, river level logjam. Depending on the level this logjam could be fully submerged or a sweeper. Scout the canyon and/or portage if you're not confident you can make it through.\nHot Springs to Lake - Class II\nPut in at the hot springs or just below the bridge downstream of the hot springs. A trail on river right gives easy access to the river here. Below the hot springs the river spreads out across a gravel floodplain. While this section is technically straightforwards, there is a ton of wood in part of the river. Be aware of your surroundings while you're paddling and choose your channels carefully.\nOn a nice day this stretch of river is very popular with jet boats and with few paddlers on this river, don't assume they'll be looking out for you. The\nPitt River Fishing Lodge\non is located river left just above the second bridge. They offer accommodation and one way water taxis across Pitt Lake. For paddlers looking for an easier trip, it may be possible to access this lower stretch via a water taxi and truck ride booked with the lodge or another local guide.\nIf you plan to camp near Pitt Lake be aware that the lake is tidal and the lower river banks and lake shore can disappear at high tide. It's possible to paddle out the lake, but be careful of strong afternoon headwinds and be ready for a long paddle. The nearest road access on this end is at Grant Narrows Park.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The kayaking never really gets good, but the semi-arid canyon scenery and roundabout access should keep you occupied for a while. Probably the best part of Prospect Creek is a class IV(+) canyon in the last kilometre before the confluence with Spius Creek (II-IV). If you can figure out the fickle flows, convoluted access, and exposed scouting you might be able to achieve the beggar's choice: an afterwork creeking run in Merritt.\nLocated on the backside of the Coquihalla, the Prospect-Spius area has a short snowmelt window in May-June. A runnable but manky flow is ~20cms on SPIUS CREEK NEAR CANFORD (08LG008). The run appears to get more quality at higher flows (e.g. photos at ~45cms), although from the scouting overlook it is not clear how committing the canyon is at that level.\n2020 hydrograph and median for SPIUS CREEK NEAR CANFORD (08LG008).\nProspect Creek has slightly easier shuttle logistics than the normal Spius Creek run. The easiest takeout is 20 minutes west of Merritt where the Prospect FSR crosses Spius Creek. To get to the put in, continue up the Propsect FSR ~16.5 km beyond the bridge (not matching the km markers), to a sharp left branch onto a 4x4 track. Drive back along and down this track as far as you can (~2km), then hike down a switchbacking ATV trail to the river (~1km), staying right at most branches. Before the last hill down into the canyon, leave your boats and walk a branch to the left, which will lead to an overlook where most of the canyon can be scouted from far above river level. Once you return to your boats and drop down the switchbacks to river level, the put in is just before Prospect Creek canyons up, and just below a logjam (2016-2019). There is an easier put in further upstream at a bridge on the Prospect FSR, but the intervening section appears to be mostly continuous class III+ full of wood with one OK waterfall.\nFrom the put in at the base of the ATV track, Prospect Creek quickly canyons up into a couple committing rapids on a corner before reaching the section scouted from the overlook. The portion visible from the overlook is the crux section, and at low flow it is a scoutable class IV rapid. At high flow, it's hard to get a good read on how continuous this section would be. After completing the ~1km long canyon on lowermost Prospect Creek, there is a ~15km paddle out along the predominantly class II-III Spius Creek, passing through the Big Box (IV) and Little Box (II).\nCabin Lake high up in the Prospect Creek drainage.\nAn OK waterfall above the recommended put in, probably would be a first descent.

Due to the amount of blind horizon lines it is not recommended to show yourself down. The Upper Puntledge River is located in a run-of-river hydropower section that needs heavy rain or snowmelt to trigger a release from the BC Hydro dam upstream. Paddlers usually continue through the Lower Puntledge (III+). Look for these runs and others in a guidebook by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nFlows\nFlows in the Upper Puntledge are released from the BC Hydro's Comox Dam (PUNTLEDGE RIVER BELOW DIVERSION 08HB084).\u00a0 Recommended flows for the Upper Puntledge are 80-120cms.\nBC Hydro provides release forecasts for the Comox Dam for the upcoming 3-4 days on its website. Use the \"Forecast Puntledge River Gauge 6 Flow,\" not the \"Forecast Comox Discharge.\"\nhttps://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/transmission-reservoir-data/reservoir-discharges/comox-dam.html\nThe dam releases are most common just before and during big rain events, to make room in the reservoir for the incoming water. Releases are often timed for low tide to prevent flooding in town. High tide or the upcoming end of a storm can sometimes cause the release to end abruptly.\u00a0 In years past, BC Hydro coordinated a dam release for one weekend in May or June for the Puntledge River Paddle Festival.\n2010 hydrograph, maximum, median and minimum flows for the PUNTLEDGE RIVER BELOW DIVERSION (08HB084). The maximum values (green) should give an impression of what time of year the river be more likely to have a dam release. The 2010 values (red) give an example year and also show the unpredictable nature of these releases.\nAn example of the BC Hydro discharge forecast chart. Use the \"Forecast Puntledge River Gauge 6 Flow,\" not the \"Forecast Comox Discharge.\" The difference is going through the pipe.\nShuttle\nAccess to the take out for the Lower Puntledge (III+) is easy, with many options located in downtown Courtenay, a common one being at the bridge on Condensory Road. Access to the put in for the Upper Puntledge (V) is found off Forbidden Plateau Road at Barber's Hole Parking for Nymph Falls Regional Nature Park. From the parking lot, which is located next to a huge field/airstrip, walk ~500m upstream to the southwest along trails and an old road to a put in on river left, just below the diversion dam. The dam release sirens will probably be going off.\nBC Hydro map of Puntledge recreation area.\nOn the water\nFind a guide to show you down. Scouting is not practical due to very long rapids with forested banks, and would often be trespassing on private property. The run consists of several complex and sometimes shallow slides, often with huge ledge holes at the end. Fish ladders have been constructed within many of these slides, and must be avoided. Logs are often sprinkled around the wide riverbed and hung up on the slides.\nIn addition to the slides, there are two notably larger drops: Nymph Falls and Stotan Falls. Located fairly early on in the run, Nymph Falls is usually run down the right channel, which is a steep and fast slide about 10m tall with an undercut right wall. Trails on river left give a partial view of the approach to this slide, but the crux remains out of view behind the island. Further downstream just after the second road bridge (Duncan Bay Mainline), Stotan Falls is a very fun multi-tiered drop run down the left channel: a couple vertical 5m drops combined with holes and slides. Shortly after Stotan Falls, the confluence with the Browns River is on the left, which marks the beginning of the play run. Most paddlers finish by paddling out the Lower Puntledge play run (III+) to Courtenay, watching out for the riverwide weir at the hatchery.\nThe left channel at Nymph Falls is not recommended. The right channel that is usually run is in the far background.\nStotan Falls looking downstream.\nStotan Falls.\nMuch of the time the Puntledge River flows through this pipe on river right.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

With the local First Nation on board, it is only the kayaking community that can preserve the recreational value of this creek if the project moves forward.\nThere's not a lot to say about Rogers Creek that hasn't already been said. It's one of the iconic river reaches in the South Coast area of BC, largely due to the incredibly clean and visually pleasing triple falls in its gorge. You know the one. It's as good as you think it is. The rest of the creek is a fun paddle through a deep granite canyon with several great rapids above and below the falls. The whole package is rounded off by a pleasant bushwhack from the access road to the creek - it wouldn't be BC without a bushwhack now would it?\nThe flow on Rogers is visual only. July or August will be the best betting time to hit it at a good flow, with both the weather of the week and that season's snowpack playing a role in exactly when it will be good. It isn't glacier fed, so it will dry up eventually. At the take out, the river will look quite low but navigable - check out the photo below to reference a medium level. If you're really concerned about the level you can head up the river right logging road to the 1 km marker where you can see down to the triple falls. This is the make-or-break point in terms of water level - the limiting factor is your ability to paddle over the boil in the pool between drops one and two to run the second one on the left.\nRogers Creek is found about 1 hour / 45 km south on the east side FSR of Lillooet Lake/Lillooet River, leaving from highway 99. It's dusty but scenic. The take out is where the road crosses the creek. It isn't signed, but it is the first major river you cross on the drive south. Alternatively you can paddle out on to the Lillooet River and float a few kilometers downstream to the Skookumchuck/St. Agnes Well hot spring, which is a great place to camp out. There are roads up both sides of Rogers - the best access to the normal run is up the river right FSR (which is signed), several hundred meters north of the bridge. Get up here however you can - without 4x4 you might have to park at the bottom of the hill and walk - at the first clear cut (now heavily grown in) after the switchbacks you'll want to bushwhack in along the downstream side. There is more whitewater further upstream, including another triple drop.\nThere have been access issues here in the past. Frankly, the native land owners in the area are aggressively unfriendly. If you want to avoid conflict, don't screw around at the take out and don't leave a shuttle vehicle parked right at the bridge. The lands surrounding Rogers are unsettled treaty lands, which the In-SHUCK-ch Nation will eventually own. You do, however have the right to use the creek, the details of which are\ndescribed in this document\n. Specifically, roads remain Crown property, reasonable access for recreation is allowed (Ch. 5, clause 1) and the public right to navigation is unaffected (Ch. 5, clause 9).\nThe creek after you whack down the clear cut will be wide. The first section is rocky but all good to go. You'll quickly come to a 6-8 foot ledge with a twisty lead in that marks the entrance to the gorge. Some great boulder pile rapids ensue - after you run a drop that pinches up against the right canyon wall eddy out below on the left to check out the falls.\nThe line at the triple is apparent. Go left on the second one as the hole on the right is a nasty place to swim. Take a while and soak in the splendor here. If you have to, the falls can be portaged (or you can hike back up to run them again) on river left. After the falls there is one more rapid - perhaps the best one on the creek - and then some fun boogie (if it isn't low) down to the take out bridge. Quietly paddle past the cabin on river right - if you make it down in one piece, might as well go for a second lap...\nGauge rock - river left, upstream of the takeout bridge.  This is a nice medium level.\nBoulder junk at the start of the run.  Photo by Steve Bartrom.\nThe real entrance to the heart of the gorge.\nThe last rapid above the falls.

Miles of continuous boulder rapids and a handful of quality bedrock drops including a perfect 20 footer make this a river not to be missed. It is a challenging run and it is very testing at high levels. Part of its allure is the difficulty in finding it with a good flow - if you get there and it's running, put on and don't miss out.\nThe Rutherford has a tragic history. It was one of the first classic whitewater runs in Squamish-Whistler to become the victim of a run-of-river hydro project. A 9 km long diversion tunnel now drains the river of all its water for the majority of the year - it can now only be run at the height of the summer when the diversion is overwhelmed. In exchange for losing natural flow, the local kayak community negotiated the construction of an artificial whitewater course below the powerhouse. However, it is of little consolation as it seems to only get used by slalom boaters once or twice a year - far fewer days then the river was runnable prior to the dam.\nThe take out for the Rutherford is found where the river runs under the highway 99 bridge just west of Pemberton. You'll see the powerhouse for the hydro project and the artificial course on the downstream side of the road. The access road for the river is on the river left side, and it is well marked as the Rutherford Creek Forest Service Road. There is ample parking just as you turn onto the Forest Service road near the rail bridge.\nThe most commonly paddled sections of the Rutherford are found below the diversion dam. There are convenient km markers along the dirt road up the river - the access points are where the river runs close to the road. The first put in is at km 3 - this is the split between the upper and lower halves of the run. Starting at the 7 km road marker is ideal - all you have to do is bash through 50 meters of bushes to get to the water. You can also just start at the dam a few km further up stream. Doing the whole thing is recommended - the half way access is a good bail out point if you want off the river.\nPrior to the construction of the dam, the Rutherford ran at good levels for a long window during the summer months. Currently it is only possible to boat the Rutherford during times of peak snowmelt, which is often limited to the first hot weather of the summer in June when there is still a lot of snow in the mountains. You can easily check out how much water is in the river at the take out, but there is not a great visual gauge. There is an\nonline gauge\nprovided by the power company that is usually functional. 20 cms in the river below the dam is medium.\nOnce on the water, the river starts off with some class IV continuous boulder rapids. Much of the river can easily be boat scouted - get out and look where necessary. After passing the clean 20 footer carefully run the next short section and stop above a towering horizion line - there is no pool above this drop. This is a marginal 40 foot waterfall with another bad rapid below - both can be portaged with some bushwhacking on river right.\nAfter the portage come several bedrock drops and a couple of steeper boulder sections, and all to quickly you'll arrive at the half-way access point. From here down it's almost exclusively continuous boulder rapids. The highlight of this stretch is a big triple drop - it's easy to recognize from the horizon line. The lower half is generally more challenging than the upper stretch.\nBe on the lookout now for the second near mandatory portage - as with the first there isn't much slack above it - it has been run both intentionally and unintentionally. Portage this on the right as well. Not far below this last big drop the bridge will come into sight and you can celebrate having successfully descended the Rutherford!\nThe powerhouse and dry whitewater course on the Rutherford.\nAn out of date visual gauge - this is a low flow for the Rutherford.\nThe short bushwhack to the water.\nMatt on the nice 20 foot drop near the top.\nThe top of the portage around the 40 footer.\nThe horrible rapid below the waterfall that for most will mandate the portage.\nA bedrock rapid found on the Rutherford.\nA standard boulder rapid.\nCrux of the triple drop.\nOne of the last rapids on the river - a good way to end the day.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Class V at high flows.\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy\nTime\n1-3 hours\nWhen to Go\nAny time it's hot.\nGauge\n9.37cms\u2193 (Oct 21 04:35)\n!\nThe Lower Ryan is quickly becoming a local classic, but rarely gets visits from out of towners due to it being past the whitewater hotspot of Whistler. However, if you can summon the courage to drive past the Cheak and down to the sleepy town of Pemberton you're in for a treat with the Lower Ryan. Jam packed with class 4/5 boulder garden rapids, almost too many boofable rocks to handle, and nearly 10 kms of it make for an incredible run.\nWhen you get to Pemberton, turn left at the lights and drive through town. Head out the Pemberton Meadows for 12 minutes or so until you pass a huge barn painted with a Canada flag. At the next right hand corner you'll see a long straight driveway on your left, with a parallel logging road to it. That's your road. Down the road and into the forest you'll take the first left up onto the dyke and once you see the river that's the takeout. Heading upstream from here you'll want a vehicle with some clearance and ideally 4x4 as the going gets a little rough at 7 km. Driving upstream there is a very quick fork. Take the left to go look at the bridge rapid that most people portage, as well as one of the biggest rapids just below that. Go right to head to the top! At the 7 km mark there is a pull off on the left. If you want to bite off a little less of the Ryan hike in the old road there to the river. If you're in for the full thing saddle up, and drive up the beat up road to the right. There's a small fork to the left a km up, then another km or so and you'll come to a cleared area where cars can turn around. Park there. Just 20 m further up the road is a trail on the left marked with some stones. Head to the river from there!\nOnce on the river things start quickly with class 4 read and run boulder gardens. After a couple of turns there is a big bend to the right marking the first notable rapid called Fight Club. Enter left, moving right, after the river makes the left bend stay right to avoid the nastiness in the center. From here a bunch more class 4 boogie comes at you but in a class 5 context due to the continuous nature of the river. Soon you'll reach the blown out old bridge at the 7 km mark. In about a km you'll reach a cool rapid coined Stackistan with two distinct ledges. Lots of lines to choose from here with various holes to dodge or boof. After this things start to slowly subside. Still some more class 4 boogie then as it starts to chill out to class 3 keep your wits about you as wood often plagues this lower section. As of 2025 you can paddle around all the logs in the river. When you see the power lines and bridge approaching ahead you'll eddy out on river left just upstream of the bridge. Hop out here. Most people portage the nasty rapid just upstream of the bridge and then make your decision if you paddle the last rapid or not. It's a long class 5 rapid that is surprisingly awesome, but rather intimidating looking. Just downstream from this rapid the river braids and you take the left channel down to your car!\nAs for flows... low but good to go between 30 and 40 cms, medium between 40 to 50 cms, and high anything above that. Highest descent since the gauge was put in as of June 2025 was 78 cms but they put in at the 7 km mark.\nThis run does not get the attention it deserves. There are so many line options, a seemingly limitless flow level you can test yourself with, and boofs all over. You gotta get there. That being said it is fast and continuous and at medium to high flows a swim would really not be a good idea. Paddle strong, paddle fast, boof everything and you're bound for an awesome time.\nCursin' through Fight Club.\nStackistan.\nScouting the final rapid after the bridge.\nThe lower stretches of the final rapid.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Hard kayaking.\nClass\nV\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to moderate, at river level.\nTime\n5-6 hours including the hike in.\nWhen to Go\nLate season: September-October.\nGauge\n36.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nThe Ryan River is a major tributary of the Lillooet River just north of Pemberton - despite its proximity to the ever popular destination of Whistler, this run rarely gets boated. The upper stretch of this run flows well into the fall; for much of the summer it is far too high to consider. As it's glacier fed and needs relatively low flow, look to come here when the nights start to get cold and the leaves begin to turn - expect a hike in to a stout section of very steep boulder rapids that are good, but a little bit junky.\nGetting to the Ryan is not obvious - the BC Backroads Mapbook and\nthis map\nshould clarify things. From Pemberton, head north out of town on the Pemberton Valley Road. You'll shortly cross over the Ryan, which meanders through the lowlands of the Lillooet Valley and is largely unimpressive here. In the distance to the west you'll see the Ryan valley. There is a forest service road up the Ryan valley, however it is currently not passable to the put in due to several washed out bridges from the floods of 2003. The obvious road in the Backroads map book (the one that heads directly west from the highway into the valley) is marked as private. If you continue another 100 meters there is a second turn that heads down an old overgrown road that will bring you to the FSR, and it is not signed as private.\nIf you've taken the overgrown road, turn left when you get to the end then turn right at the 4-way intersection and start driving up the valley. If you came along the private drive keep straight. Continue along the FSR until you reach the end of the road - this is the location of the washed out bridge whose remains are in the clearing, and the take out. Ferry to the other side of the river and hike to the top.\nFlows on the Ryan are visual and unless you've been there before it will be difficult to gauge. Flows should correlate to those on the Lillooet which has an online gauge. Late summer and early fall are the best betting times. Flows of about 100 cms on the Lillooet gauge gave a medium to medium-high level on the Ryan.\nFrom the take out it doesn't look like a road continues on the other side. If you go straight across to where it looks like the old bridge footing used to be the road is indeed there but it's very overgrown. Unless industry again set their sights on the Ryan valley the road is probably not going to be rebuilt. To reach the put in you have to hike up the old road - it is overgrown to the point of being difficult to follow in places. Don't freak out when the road goes downstream at the start - it quickly swings back around. Plan on walking for 2-3 hours. You can start wherever you see fit - the river eventually gets flat as you head up the valley - start at the second major creek crossing/massive washout if you want to get all of the whitewater.\nThere is not a lot of point in trying to describe the river. The first half of the trip is very steep, continuous whitewater where everything has to be scouted. There are some huge boulder rapids in this section - luckily river level scouting and portaging is possible along the whole length of the run. All the nasty stuff is in play on this section - wood, sieves, holes and bad rocks. Expect some great whitewater and a few spots with some solid mank. For reference, I feel this section is steeper and harder than the\nBottom Mile of the Ashlu\n.\nAbout half way down the run the whitewater begins to relent. You can start to boat scout some things, and you'll eventually be able to bomb long sections of fun class IV. Once this boogie begins it will stay that way until the end, which comes all too quickly. You can't miss the take out - you'll see your cars and the remains of the old bridge. There is a lower run on the Ryan starting from the take out for the upper but it's recommended to run this section when the river is higher.\nThis beta is from September 27th, Environment Canada Lillooet River gauge - note the peak flow the night before was about 125 cms dropping to 100 cms the next night..\nThe steep uphill at the start of the Upper Ryan hike in.\nWonderful fall views in the Ryan valley.\nSome easy stuff near the top of the run.\nNice fall colors - calm before the storm.\nTypical small drop on the upper half.\nTypical big drop on the upper half.\nSteep boulders.

You would never know it's in the heart of North Van.\nClass\nHighly level dependent - ranges from fun class IV to raging class V.\nScouting / Portaging\nModerate scouting, difficult to impossible portaging.\nTime\n1.5 hours including the hike for a first run.\nWhen to Go\nRain-fed all year, snowmelt in the spring and summer.\nGauge\n4.435cms\u2193 (Dec 31 14:00)\nOn December 7, 2014, a large rockslide occurred in the Seymour Canyon at the rapid known as Mosh Pit. This catastrophic event dumped 50,000 cubic meters of rock in the river, creating a large pile of boulder debris that dammed the river to form a lake that extends far above the Twin Bridges put in, drowning the first three rapids in 30+ feet of water. The cataract formed by the debris is currently unrunnable. The impact on kayaking is significant and irreversible. This event had similar significant impacts on hiking and mountain biking trails, and as the Twin Bridge at the historic Canyon put in was removed, a critical river crossing in the Lower Seymour Conversation Reserve trail system was lost. Efforts to blow up the landslide are ongoing (to save the salmon of course) - it remains to be seen whether it will eventually become runnable again. This blasting is currently having a negative impact on kayak navigaiton. The first rapid cycles between runnable and unrunnable as jagged blast rock slowly trickles down river during high flow events.\nThe Seymour Canyon is a classic local run. And local it is - this river literally runs through the middle of North Vancouver. It's also short - so much so that you can drive to the trailhead (it's a hike to the top), get geared up, hike up, paddle and drive home in less than an hour and a half - kind of like going to the gym, but better. The whitewater on the Seymour is great stuff - not too steep, pool-drop and in an impressive canyon that is as beautiful and intimidating as any other in the area. Although the 2014 landslide shortened the length of the run, it is still worth the effort as the majority of the rapids remain unchanged.\nSeymour access is easy. While there is a road to the put in, it is much faster to just walk up the well maintained trail from the take out. Go to Riverside Drive in North Vancouver and drive to the north end of the road - it is a dead end. About 100 meters before the end of the road is a gate and a big set of stairs down to the river - park near here as this is where you'll come up from the water. From May through October you'll need a permit to park anywhere around here, and also during that time the gate at the top of the stairs is locked. There is an alternative take out about 500 meters back down Riverside at the end of Swinburne Avenue. The hike to the top takes around 20 minutes - follow the obvious river left trail at the end of the road. The put in is below the landslide site down an obvious gully. Access to the new lake is closed indefinitely.\nOne of the great things about the Seymour is that it is accessible at a wide range of water levels. There is a convenient painted rock gauge upstream of the Mt. Seymour Parkway bridge that is most commonly used for a visual level. Precise levels on the rock are open to interpretation. There is also an\nonline gauge\n, but the flow updates are often a few hours behind the current time, and there is variation depending on the time of year and whether the river is rising or falling.\nLow water is about 2 on the rock. It can be run lower but it sucks. Medium water is 3 on the rock, and anything over 4.5 on the rock is high. At 2 the Seymour is a low stress, low volume class III-IV run. Jack to level up to 3 and you're looking at mainly class IV whitewater with a walkable IV+ rapid at the end. When the gauge reads 5 (just spilling over the top of the rock) this river is a serious class V section of whitewater with few eddies and very pushy lines. You'll need to go run it yourself to find your upper comfort level. Online flows of 15 to 45 cms roughly correlate to 2.5 to 5 on the rock. The online gauge tends to read low in the winter.\nThe Seymour used to start with a short section of wide, bouldery whitewater before you got to the entrance of the canyon. There were two small rapids (a flume and a boof) then the first major rapid called Mosh Pit. These rapids are gone, replaced by a lake and a huge sieve-filled cataract. The kayaking now starts below the rockslide where you essentially launch directly into the first rapid called Boney Drop. A series of class IV rapids lead to the two big rapids called Triple Drop and Final Exam. Final Exam is the crux rapid of the run at all reasonable levels and it can be semi-portaged on the left if the level is below 4. It is easily scouted from the trail at the pipeline bridge on the hike in. Once the canyon walls fall away, take out at the rock outcrop and hike the 130+ stairs back up to your car.\nThe gauge rock upstream of Mt. Seymour Pky.  A nice level of 3.5.\nPleasant hiking to the top.\nLaunching in at the new access point with the rockslide rapid in the background.\nSome of the early rapids - it's a big canyon.\nTaking it all in during a rare juicy mid summer flow window.\nA dynamic pillow move, most fun at higher flows.\nThe calm stretch above Triple Drop.\nTriple Drop at 3.5.\nThe tricky entrance to Final Exam.\nFinal Exam from high on river right.\nThe exit of Seymour Canyon at high water.\nHistorical Seymour Photos\nThis was the pool that existed above Mosh Pit prior to the landslide.  Mosh Pit was the first of the three big rapids in the original Seymour Canyon run.  Upstream are the two warmup rapids, which are now submerged under 30+ feet of water.  This photo was taken from the approximate location of the landslide.\nThis was the entrance move to Mosh Pit.  This rapid changed over the years as pieces of rock fell from the right wall.  The catastrophic change from the landslide in 2014 was exponentially bigger than any other rockfall seen before.\nA downstream view of Mosh Pit.  The bedrock pinch at the bottom of this rapid remains identifiable as none of the large boulders from the landslide made it that far down river.  The two rapids after Mosh Pit changed as well due to smaller debris from the landslide flushing downstream.  The logs spanning the river in this photo appeared during a flood in early 2010, and washed away during a flood in October 2014.\nA view of the bottom half of Most Pit from high on river left.  This viewpoint is still there - it's a good spot to look at the landslide and the new rapid.\nSeymour Canyon Trivia\nThe last descent (unknowingly at the time) of the Seymour Canyon's upper rapids that were erased by the landslide was by Steve Arns and Will Riorden on Dec 6, 2014.\nA staff gauge was located at the old Twin Bridge put in before the rockslide. The normal runnable flows ranged between 0.7 and 1.4 meters.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Some rebar on river right between Mt. Seymour Parkway and Dollarton Highway bridges. Access and parking at the put-in have been problematic \u2013 see directions.\nDirections\n: A possible put-in is at a set of stairs down to the river south of property 2301 Riverside Drive in North Vancouver. During the summer months this access point is blocked by a locked gate and parking is restricted to residents. There is a second, lower put-in at Swinburn Avenue. To reach the take-out drive south on Riverside Dr across Mt Seymour Parkway. Turn right on Dollarton Hwy and left again at Riverside Drive West. Immediately after railroad tracks turn right and follow a road to the water.\nDescription\n: This run is great for beginners at low and medium water levels, with lots of boulders to practice your eddy turns and ferries. The boulder gardens turn into hole gardens at higher levels. When the river is high (>6 on the gauge) and the tide is low (<3m) an almost river-wide breaking wave forms below Dollarton Highway Bridge at an underwater pipeline. Good (but sometimes shallow) play is to be had.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Mountain views.\nLength of Run\n: 12.5 km\nLength of Shuttle (one way)\n: 11.5 km\nDirections\n: In North Vancouver, take Exit 22 from Hwy 1. Follow Lillooet Road north past Capilano College and the North Vancouver Cemetery to Seymour Demonstration Forest (about 5 km). Check in with the park warden to get access beyond the gate (see details below). To reach the put-in, continue on the road for about 9 km. At Spur 7 turn right. Go straight onto a gravel spur and drive until you get to the river. Check with the park warden on where to take out and how to get there.\nDescription\n: At higher water this run has lots of play waves. At lower water there are many small boulder gardens and some flat sections. Not much happens in respect to whitewater until you get to the bridge at spur 4. Below the bridge, there are several boulder gardens and near the end of the run a couple of class III. The last one has a headwall that has caused trouble for quite a few paddlers it is possible to take-out before these last 2 rapids but the recommended take-out is at the old bridge abutment.\nAccess:\nFor Vancouver Whitewater Club and Beaver Canoe Club there is a special agreement to be able to access and paddle the Upper Seymour River in the Lower Seymour Conservatory.\u00a0 This is a privilege and there are some strict rules to follow, please respect these and be careful especially with speed limits and on the takeout road.\u00a0 Many years ago there was an unfortunate accident where someone swam on this section and drowned flowing straight down into a high water canyon section.\u00a0 Since then a landslide changed the canyon section so there is a short lake between the sections so a repeat of this accident is unlikely.\nFor access only one group is permitted at one time so please coordinate on the Vancouver Whitewater Club channels.\u00a0 There only needs to be one active club member in your group but they will be nominated the group leader for the paperwork.\nDrive to the Rice Lake Gate, stop and go chat to the warden.\u00a0 Tell them you are with Vancouver Kayak Club (our old name) or Beaver Canoe Club and fill out your names and license plates and indicate a time you will be out and fill in an emergency contact.\nThey will give you a pass to display on your dash and keys to access the take out road and a copy of the rules including a map.\nDrive up to either Spur 4 (obviously sign-posted) or Spur 7, which is where there is a turn just before a gate.\u00a0 Cars are not permitted to park on the beach at Spur 7, and the rules say to park on the pavement so we walked the 30m from there to the river.\nAccessing the take-out requires a key and you can in fact drive all the way down to the suspension bridge and park by the river.\u00a0 On this road (particularly when driving up) please use extreme caution!! Pedestrians may glare at you and Cyclists will not be expecting to see you, turn on your 4way blinkers and you are encouraged to use your horn on blind corners to let others know you are there.\nYou are not permitted to paddle downstream from here as there is the landslide just before the Seymour canyon and you cannot use this as a way to drop boats for the Seymour Canyon either.\nWhen you are done please return your pass and key to the warden. Be mindful of what time the main gate to the area closes, in winter it is 5pm.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Often overshadowed by the whitewater found in the Squamish/Whistler area of southwest BC, this run (and the area in general) boasts a wide variety of quality boulder garden rapids of varying difficulty and a season that can extend well into the winter owing to its relatively low elevation and copious rainfall in the area. There's not much else to be said aside from it is a run that is well worth going to paddle.\nThe level on Silverhope is visual only - you need to go to the river to get an exact picture of flows. There may be online gauge correlations, particularly with gauges on the US side of the border, but nothing is obvious or nearby. In a broad sense, Silverhope has a typical early BC snowmelt window from May to July and it will run after rain in the fall and winter, provided the snow line is high enough. The\nFraser Valley Whitewater Facebook page\nwill often have an up-to-date visual report on the flow of this run as well. The run is roadside, so gauging the difficulty of the rapids is easily done while running shuttle.\nSilverhope Creek runs through the town of Hope, approximately 1.5 hours east of Vancouver. To reach the river, exit highway 1 at exit 168, following Flood-Hope Road. This quickly brings you to Silver-Skagit Road, which follows the river upstream. The lower river is splashy class III. Near the 3 km marker a small creek passes under the road, which is the usual take out. There are optional class V rapids below here - just walk back up to your car if you run them. Continuing upstream, the road will cross from river left to river right. Keep left at the major fork. Several hundred meters past the fork is an undeveloped campsite that gives easy access to the river. The uppermost put in is at the lake just another 1km up the road.\nSilverhope is a unique river in that there are several distinct sections adjacent to one another of different difficulties. Starting at the campsite and finishing at the creek gives a pleasant class IV-IV+ roadside boulder run with a few surprises here and there. The rapids just below the creek takeout (you won't miss them) are solid class V and are completely optional. Putting in at the lake delivers the most challenging section of the run - on top of more class V whitewater the scouting is tough and there is a fair bit of wood in the riverbed. More adventurous teams will enjoy sorting out the run from the lake down - for a mellower run with some spice at the end just start at the campsite. The middle section of Silverhope can handle a fair bit of water and remains runnable when the upper and lower sections are a little too juicy for comfort.\nHere are a few photos of the run to get you interested - enjoy!\nScouting the woody steep section right out of the lake.\nA double drop below the lake.\nTypical boogie in the middle stretch of the run.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

It's all read and run for those skilled enough to be in here at these levels with big holes, haystacks and headwalls that create big boils and eddy lines. After a quick blast there is a bit of a break before the action ramps up again and all too soon you're out of the first canyon and into a stretch of flatwater. This first canyon is similar to the Nahatlatch canyon at equivalent water levels or an easier version of Skookumchuk Creek.\nIf taking out at the mid-way point be sure to be watching a GPS or keeping your eyes glued to the right bank, you'll see the road just a bit above the river and then around the next couple of bends watch out for the campsite which is easy to miss!\nExiting the 2nd Canyon\nThere is a long section of flat water between the canyons so be prepared for a long day and a long paddle!\nThe second canyon, which is longer, more constricted and more continuous with more difficult moves. This canyon has very different geology from the first as well as going under/through/around the mine. Where it constricts at the mine and goes around a few bends is a highlight of the run. You get nearly vertical canyon walls and a 20-30 foot wide river, machinery and equipment around, conveyor belts going over the river transporting ore from one side to the processing plant on the other, the remains of the old Similkameen Valley Railway (a branch of the Kettle Valley Railway) preserved as old trestles at the top of the canyon. Eventually you will also pass the tailings ponds contained as a giant earthen dam. At some points you'll also notice bad smells coming from the water, mind the water quality after passing the mine. All of this is happening as you're facing what most consider the most difficult whitewater of the run!\nOnce through this stretch and some more flats you'll arrive at a nice beach with a really good, friendly surf wave. This is a great place to relax and catch some surf.\nOn river right is Elkridge Outdoors which can only be used as a take-out when kayaking events are run through one of the local clubs.\nThe last stretch of flats (12 km or so) actually isn't bad as there are some waves, small rapids and decent boofs adorning the river.\nTake out at either A&W or Two Rivers Park where the Tulameen meets the Similkameen.\nOther rivers in the area...\nMore sections of the Similkameen, Tulameen, Granite Creek, Ashnola, Pasayten River, Hayes Creek, and a few on the way from Vancouver on Highway 3, Skagit River, Sumallo Riverm, Nicolum River, Silverhope River.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The roadless section below Highway 3 offers scenic floating through old growth forests, of course with a healthy serving of logjams. It's worth doing once. During the long shuttle you will drive past\nSilverhope Creek (IV/V)\nand Coquihalla Canyon (IV), both of which will probably be flowing at the same time of year.\nOccupying a transition zone between the coast and the interior, the Skagit will have a late spring snowmelt season in May-June similar to the Similkameen. Winter rainfall events may be possible. A flow of 40cms on the Skagit River above Klesilkwa River gauge is a medium high flow, with some effort required to stop above riverwide wood. The section is probably runnable lower, maybe down to 15cms as it is a quite open riverbed.\nOne challenge with this section is the long shuttle. To get to the takeout, drive from Hope ~42km up the Silver Skagit Road, or a further ~20km if you are taking out at Ross Lake. To get to the put in, drive back to Hope, and then ~34km east on Highway 3 to Sumallo Grove. Yes, the shuttle is ~80km each way for a ~12km section. There is a riverside trail if you can figure out a way to utilize that somehow.\nAt Sumallo Grove, put in on either the Skagit or Sumallo Rivers, which join just downstream. Almost immediately riverwide wood is a hazard, and expect to get out and portage through the bush several times on this run. After about 3km of class II, the river will steepen noticeably into a ~1km section of read and run class III ending at Delacy Camp. Below here it is more class II and logjams to the first takeout at 26 Mile Bridge on the Silver Skagit road. You can continue downstream from here, on relatively wood-free class I to Strawberry Bar; in fact, this may be the best section to experience the forest from your boat instead of carrying your boat through the forest. Below Strawberry Bar, expect at least one more heinous log jam before reaching Ross Lake, unless it is too low to have any water on the Canadian side.\nRhododendron stands near Sumallo Grove.\nThe roadless section of the Skagit River.\nOld growth cedars along the Skagit River Trail.\nSkagit River Cottonwoods Ecological Reserve.\nA truly special section where the river flows through burned log piles just before reaching the Silver Skagit Road.\nClass I floating near the Silver Skagit Road, towards Hozomeen Mountain in North Cascades National Park.\nA really inconvenient logjam below Strawberry Bar.\nPonderosa Pine groves in Chittenden Meadow.\nA possible take out at Ross Lake at the US border, as long as it has water and you love portaging logjams.\nBC Parks\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Awesome surroundings.\nClass\nIII, massive volume.\nScouting / Portaging\nN/A.\nTime\nThe wave will be in good form for 2-4 hours, depending on the tide exchange.\nWhen to Go\nSpring through fall.  Usually runs during the night in the winter.\nSkookumchuck is a classic surf wave found at the Skookumchuck Narrows tidal rapid in the Sunshine Coast region of southwest BC. This wave, formed when a rising tide tries to squeeze its way through the narrows into Sechelt Inlet, is everything from a small rolling wave to a foaming beast good for throwing any trick, and everything in between. Really, there's not a lot to say about Skooks aside from it's a great place to hang out, even if you're not a hard core play boater.\nHere is some basic info to plan a trip there. Skookumchuck is found at Skookumchuck Narrows Provincial Park near the town of Egmont on the Sunshine Coast. You can only access the Sunshine Coast by ferry from Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver. Egmont is a small town with not much more than a pub and a general store. There is camping nearby. The wave forms on a flood tide when the current is greater than 11 knots. It is appropriate for intermediates at lower tides (11-12 knots) while advanced boaters will enjoy it more in the 13-16 knot range. On the higher end (15-16 knots) the wave will green out during the flood cycle. 12-15 is generally seen as optimal. The run out can get pretty heavy on large tides. You can get to the wave by either paddling out from Egmont or by hiking along a well maintained trail. Both options take about 1 hour.\nUseful links:\nCanadian Government Tide Charts\n- Use link to 'Predictions' and find Volume 5, Sechelt Rapids.\nSkookumchuck Tide Chart\n- Information about Skookumchuck Narrows.

River running at medium-high water with more of a creeky feel at medium-low water.\nClass\nIII+-IV\nScouting / Portaging\nScouting is not difficult, however it would take far too long to scout all of the rapids on the run from the bank.\nTime\n2-5 hours\nWhen to Go\nSpring and Summer\nSkookumchuck Creek has been described as the best class 4 run that mere mortals can aspire to. It starts off with a great class 2 warm up that slowly builds to class 3+/4 that sustains itself for nearly 16 km with very few flat spots until it eases back to class 2 with scattered bigger rapids for the last few km.\nThis run has too many rapids to name or describe. They are consistent in difficulty for nearly the entire way with a few slightly larger or longer rapids.\u00a0 Skook is an incredibly high quality run. High water provides exceptional river running down really continuous whitewater full of surging waves and powerful holes. Medium water makes for really playful rapids full of boofs, eddies and green tongues. Low water slows things down and is about the best intro to creeking for intermediate paddlers there is with bigger eddies, narrow slots, less powerful currents and uncountable opportunities to practice little boofs.\nAs with any BC river be on the lookout for wood. There is nearly always something in play somewhere along the run.\nFlows\n: There is a painted rock gauge at the takeout. 1 is low, 3 is high. It can certainly be run higher, but does turn very fast and continuous with few eddies and shoreline trees become a real hazard.\nTypically this river runs at good flows in early to mid summer, after the spring flood.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Flows are usually changing quickly.\nGauge\n2.7cms\u2193 (Aug 14 10:54)\nSkookum Creek was irreversibly altered by a run of river hydro project that came online in the spring of 2014 that dewaters the whole section of whitewater. The kayaking community lost the fight to have any recreational releases on this creek, and there is now almost no opportunity for navigation.\nSkookum is a small creek with some big waterfalls found deep in the forest north of Squamish. Another in a long list of classic class V whitewater runs in the area, it is a great paddle with tough scouting, challenging gorges and some of the best waterfalls in the Squamish area. Historically challenged by difficult access which was solved by the construction of a power project, Skookum Creek is now almost impossible to catch with a flow appropriate and stable enough for kayaking. The creek now stands as a stark example of everything negative concerning the effects of hydro development on whitewater recreation.\nDirections\nThe take out is easy to find, at the confluence of Skookum Creek and the Mamquam River. Simply follow the Mamquam FSR, found on the far west side of Squamish, for about 15 km until you cross the Mamquam. Immediately on the other side of this bridge is a bridge over Skookum, which is the take out. Alternatively use the powerhouse access just upstream. Put in access changed during the construction of the power project, and the optimal put in has yet to be described but it is likely from river left using the power project roads. Starting at the dam puts you in the river well above the old starting point, but it is now the obvious choice. The original starting point was about 3 km above the take out. It's also possible to access the creek from the river right logging road.\nFlows\nAs of 2021, we have access to a gauge for Skookum Creek. This gauge is located just below the dam and represents the flow in the diversion reach -- what we kayak. We are still working to establish minimums and maximums but 8-15cms is a good starting point with 8 being quite low and 15 being higher than most would want it.\nCurrently, the gauge updates once daily, but in the future we expect to gain access to more regular (hourly) updates.\nOn the River\nFrom the dam down to the old put in is undescribed whitewater. From the old put in location about 3 km up from the take out are a series of narrow canyons that are difficult to scout and are seemingly impossible to portage. Wood will forever be a potential issue on this run so scout carefully. A section of relatively open class III-IV precludes the ultra classic 30ish foot waterfall that is tricky to scout and can't be walked. It is awesome. The river lands in a beautiful polished granite cauldron that boogies around the corner and shortly arrives at an even bigger waterfall. This 50-60 foot drop has a weird lip and lands in relatively green water. Portaging this drop is almost impossible and you should come to Skookum Creek with the intent to run it, or be prepared to hike out. Below here are a few more rapids, some corners, good scenery and finally the bridge at the take out. It's a good river with classic waterfalls - have fun getting in there and sorting it out, and be thankful if you had the chance to run it under natural conditions!\nThe view up the river from the take out bridge.\nA rock in the center of the river just upstream from the bridge.  Before the hydro project this was medium level.  It will have to be higher than this now to be runnable in the diverted section.\nA front seat view on the drive to the put in on a soggy wet day.

The take-out is the same as for the Chilliwack Canyon run on Chilliwack Lake Road 20.5 km east of Vedder Crossing Bridge. To get to the put-in turn right onto a gravel road (Chilli-Slesse FSR) just after the bridge over Slesse Creek on the Chilliwack Lake Road. Within a kilometer there is a branch to the right that leads to the top of Keyhole Canyon. Check it out to make sure the canyon is free of wood. Return to the main gravel road and continue for about 5 km to a bridge across the creek. This is the put-in.\nDescription\n: The run starts with several gravel bed drops. \u201cKeyhole Canyon\u201d is short and steep with plenty of water in it. The rest of the run has some steep bouldery sections and gravel bed character, pretty much what you see from the take-out bridge.

Continuous class 3, be on the lookout for wood\nClass\nIII-IV (optional V at put in)\nScouting / Portaging\nMost of the river is visible from the road. The fast continuous nature of the river makes scouting difficult.\nTime\n30 mins/lap (trick is to do a bunch of laps!)\nWhen to Go\nJune-July\nIf ever there was one word to describe the Small river, \u201csmall\u201d encapsulates it perfectly. Not only is it a narrow creek, it is also only three kilometers long. It is still a great fun time! A small shuttle makes it a fun section to run multiple times. It is also just a small distance from the hamlet of Tete Jaune making access easy if you happen to be camping in the area.\nThe put-in and take-out are accessed at the Small River rest area along Highway 16 between Tete Jaune and McBride. Leave a car at the rest area next to the picnic tables for the takeout. There is a small beach along the river right side and a trail up to the picnic tables. Remember to take out before you paddle under the highway bridge! Head up the Forest Service Road (FSR) to the put-in. This is an active FSR, and is also used by horseback riders, ATVs, and dirtbikes. Be sure to watch your speed and exercise caution around blind corners.\nThere are multiple put-in options along the river. The top option is right underneath the first bridge you come across (right at the 3 km marker). Underneath the bridge is the only named rapid of the run, called Mr. Big. It is optional class 5. Take a look from the bridge to find your line, or to see just downstream where the next put-in option is. Along the river right side, before the river turns to the left is a small access point. Put-in here for about 250 m of class 4 that ends in a river wide hole, or put-in just below this hole for the bottom put-in option.\nBlasting past the last class 4 section/feature\nFrom roughly the 2.5 km mark on the road to the take out is a lovely stretch of fast, continuous, class 3(+). There are minimal places to stop to clean up a swim and eddies are small, so a strong roll and confidence in class 3 is required. The river is mostly made up of gravel beds and shallow boulder gardens. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for wood the whole way, as this is a section that does not frequently get paddled. There are plenty of fun rocks to splat, slide, and boof off of.\nOne of many rocks to launch over\nSome typical boogie\nThere is no gauge on the Small River but there are a few other rivers in the area that could be used to approximate the flow (Dore, Canoe). Just as the river is small so is the watershed that feeds it, so it reacts to rain and warm temperatures faster than those rivers. Late June through July is usually a safe bet. As you drive up the road take a look at the river. Low water is recommended for Mr. Big, however the rest of the run would be quite bumpy. If it looks good to go, it probably is!\nFor live updates on flows, river beta, camping recommendations, and general paddle homies in the Robson Valley area, phone Justin at Stellar Descents (250) 566-0040, or check out the Robson Valley Whitewater Facebook page.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

It's fed by the large glaciers in the middle of Garibaldi Park, making it a late season run with beautiful blue water and some good whitewater. There is a short but significant canyon in the heart of this run that presents a major challenge to navigation, but with careful scouting, ambition to run class V and some luck with the wood configuration it is runnable. The whole trip is a rugged, full day of adventure kayaking.\nThe flow on Snowcap can only be measured by going out there to look. Generally, it's worth considering in July and August when Rogers Creek is in, or just too low. It might correlate with the flow on the\nUpper Cheak\n, particularly in the later part of the season when high water has ended. On two separate visits, Snowcap was at a nice medium flow when the Cheak was at ~2.40-2.45 and Rogers Creek had just run out of water for the year. If the flow is high, the canyon will get harder to run successfully.\nSnowcap is located across the Lillooet River from (and farther south than) Rogers Creek. Initially you head the same way as Rogers - south on the Lillooet East/In-SHUCK-ch FSR, found east of Pemberton off highway 99. About 25 km down this road, cross a large bridge to the Lillooet West FSR and continue south to the creek at the 51 km marker and use the road bridge as the take out. The put in is at Glacier Lake. Use the river right access road. Initially the road is in good shape as it passes through recent clear cuts, but it will quickly deteoriate. 4x4 and a vehicle you don't mind scratching are recommended. About 7.5 km up this road, a spur goes down to the lake near the river outflow.\nGlacier Lake is a wonderful put in. The river starts with some flat water, then slowly builds to nice class IV read and run with 2 larger rapids before you reach the canyon. The canyon is obvious. It's at a right bend in the river where you can't safely boat scout any further. The key to figuring out this canyon is in the scouting. First, get out on the right and scout at river level as far downstream as you can. This entrance rapid ends almost as soon as it goes around the bend. The largest rapid in the canyon is hidden around the first corner. Head high up on the right and traverse the rim, trying to gain as many views as you can. It's very steep and the bush is thick, but there are a few good vantage points. About 100 m downstream from where you started scouting there is a well definined gully you can use to get right down to water level, allowing you to scout the run out of the big rapid and the next rapids downstream. This combination of entrance scouting, rim scouting and river level scouting will allow a strong team to figure out the route through the canyon. If you end up having to portage, it takes about 30 minutes down the right side. You'll need to rope your boats up, but the terrain gradually slopes down to the rivers edge below the canyon and it's relatively easy walking. It's worth noting that more than a handful of groups have been unsuccessful here. If you can't figure it out, the portage is way easier than walking out.\nBelow the canyon are a km or two of nice class III read and run down to the take out bridge. The forest here is particularly neat. You'll probably notice the hydro gauging equipment at the take out bridge - another reminder that none of the undamed rivers of SW BC are safe from power projects.

Tolerates high water very well, but becomes class V.\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy.\nTime\n1-2 hours.\nWhen to Go\nAll summer - runnable over a wide range of levels.\nThe Soo River is the oft forgotten and somewhat underrated third member of the Whistler Triple Crown, along with the\nUpper Cheak\nand the\nCallaghan\n. While it might not have the bang-for-your-buck factor of the other two Whistler mainstays because of its location on the far side of town, the classic section of the Soo is a good class IV (or more, depending on the level) river run with entertaining rapids from start to finish.\nThe Soo is essentially roadside along highway 99 half way between Whistler and Pemberton. The take out is at the obvious dirt pull out immediately upstream of the highway 99 bridge over the river - it is easy to find. The put in is more elusive - it is found approximately 3 km back towards Whistler just as the river bends away from the road. Look for a small dirt road between the highway and the river. There are two dirt roads - both work. From where you park, figure out a way to bash down to the river and put on.\nLevels are visual only. The Soo has a particularly grey tinge to its glacial waters and can look full even when the water is medium or low if you're not familiar with the level. This river follows the general trend of high water in late May/June, dropping out to low water by mid/late August in a normal year. Interestingly the Soo tolerates high water well and can be run when other rivers in the area are blown out too high (the difficulty ramps up accordingly though). There is a useful 'stick' gauge just upstream of the takeout - see the photo below for more info.\nThe Soo from start to finish is great river running - boulder moves, fun rapids and chutes but no vertical drops. High flow turns the majority of the run into a continuous gauntlet of wavetrains and big holes. Everything is easy to bank scout or portage, and more aggressive boaters will have a blast boat scouting through all the whitewater. The two biggest rapids come back-to-back when a slope of jagged white blast rock shows up on river left. The second of the two is called Linda Lovelace. Below here things slowly ease off down to the takeout - if you're running at high flows there is a big hole lurking here that always causes moments of excitement.\nTypical Soo action.\nLinda Lovelace - the big one, medium-low flow.\nA useful gauge just upstream of the take out.  Walk upstream to where the concrete highway barrier starts and go to the river - it's near the shore next to the rip rap on the bank.  Water level with the top of the pole is high (goes much higher), water touching the concrete is medium to medium-low.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Easy access canyon with big holes.\nClass\nV\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy.\nTime\n1 hour.\nWhen to Go\nSummer - preferred when the Soo is medium and lower.\nThe Railroad Canyon of the Soo is a short, stout canyon found just above the put in of the\nclassic section of the Soo\nnear Whistler. While it's not long enough to be a whole river section by itself - any run will be followed by a trip down the classic Soo - its difficulty is so much above the classic run that it warrants its own description. It's a nice piece of whitewater that makes for an exciting start, adding a great class V challenge to the Soo.\nIt's highly recommended to run the classic run after the canyon, so use the usual Soo take out. The canyon put in is a minute or two further along highway 99 from the normal put in. Park your car at the Shadow Lake Interpretative Forest parking lot. Across the highway is an old road with a rusty yellow gate. Follow this road for about 100 meters to the obvious point where you can get in the river.\nThis section is more water level sensitive than the classic Soo. While it's possible at high water levels, most people will prefer it when the Soo is at medium or lower water levels.\nThe river is flat from the put in. There's a class IV entrance rapid above the canyon proper. Take out on the left and use the railway tracks to scout the big rapids. The canyon is a few hundred meters long, and the crux, a triple drop ending is a very large, sticky hole, is near the start. If necessary, portage along the rail bed. The classic Soo put in is just below the end of the canyon, where the fun continues!\nLooking down the upper part of the canyon, with the three river wide holes.\nUpstream view of the whole section.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

With slides, ledges, boulder gardens and a clean waterfall, Spilli has an impressive variety of whitewater for such a short run.\nThe put in is just upstream of a B.C. hydro dam/diversion which should be portaged on river right to avoid trespassing. Below the dam and after after a short warm up comes he first major rapid, \"Astro-lube\". A bit tricky to line up, with a boil/wave at the top and a narrower exit than entrance, this slide can often send people into an uncomfortable, swirling eddy against an overhanging wall on river right. Best to set up safety on river left. Another section of boogie water leads to a long boulder garden that ends with \"reach-around\", a 6 foot sloping ledge at the end of a \"z\" turn. Reach-around can be scouted by eddying out halfway down the boulder garden on either side. Immediately after reach-around is a series of ledges known as 2 in the pink and 1 in the stink (noticing a theme yet?). There is enough space to stop between 2 in the pink and the ledge that forms 1 in the stink, however it is best to scout this whole sequence from the eddy river left after reach-around. 1 in the stink (also known as L-drop) is the trickiest rapid of the run. The rapid is formed by a ramp into a hole that then drops off sideways over an 8 foot ledge. the outflow from the ledge pushes into an overhanging/undercut wall on river right. This rapid is often portaged, especially at high flows, however too high of water makes the river left portage impossible. This portage requires a little bit of scrambling and team work to pass the boats around the drop and then either scramble down to river level or \"throw and go\". The flat, moving pool below 1 in the stink drops off a clean 15-20 foot waterfall known as happy ending. The last major rapid of the run, it can be easily lapped and is the home of many a botched downriver freestyle attempt. The run-out from here to the takeout bridge still has some nice moves, and it is best to stay alert for sneaky pieces of wood in here.\nFlows: Spilli is in from 12 cms to 24 cms. If the diversion channel is flowing (visible from the takeout bridge), this takes 8cms out of the run (ie 20 to 32 cms is the runnable flow). Although it has been run higher than 24 cms it is not recommended as the portage route on river left becomes impossible and either climbing out of the canyon or portaging on river right would be quite dangerous and difficult.\nPut in/takeout: Just after Beeland on Highway 95 (travelling south) turn right onto Westside Road. Follow for a couple kilometers and then stay straight to get onto Giant Mine road (Westside rd takes a hard left at the junction of Westside and Giant Mine). Another km or 2 leads you to the takeout bridge. Stay on Giant Mine about 3-4km past the takeout bridge. Just past the B.C. Hydro access road on the left there will be a non-descript grassy area on the right that you can drive into to park. Find the trail to the river across the road and a little way downstream. B.C. Hydro has asked that we use this to access the river rather than their access road.\nAstrolube (photo by Ben Hawthorne)\nAstrolube from the bottom\nThe not-so-nice eddy at the bottom of Astrolube.

Impossible once in the canyons.\nTime\n3-4 hours.\nWhen to Go\nVery early or late season at low water.  Anything but low flows haven't been tested.\nGauge\n85.8cms\u2191 (Oct 21 06:05)\n!\nThe Upper Squamish is all about canyons - big and incredibly scenic canyons. You get the same sort of canyons as found on\nDipper Creek\nwithout having to run any big waterfalls. Truth be told the Upper Squamish is of little interest as a good kayaking run because of difficult access to paddle class III-IV or unrunnable whitewater. Despite this, it is worth doing to pass through the gorges. Do it at low water - it will quickly fill up and get very scary with any amount of water and to the best of our knowledge it hasn't been run at anything but low water in the shoulder seasons.\nAccess is along the Squamish main logging road. Head out of Squamish and up the Squamish Valley Road - pass the Ashlu and keep going. It's a bumpy ride that takes almost an hour. At the Elaho/Squamish confluence take the main river left road up the Squamish. At the first major spur head down to your left to a bridge over the river where you can put in. Put in options also exist upstream. The obvious way to take out is to paddle all the way down to where the road is right next to the river, but a large portage in the third or fourth canyon makes most groups bail early and hike up to the road.\nFlows on the Upper Squamish should be appropriate when everything is low. It might be possible with a little bit of water but it's almost certain to be unrunnable when there is any semblance of summer flow in the river. There should be a loose correlation with the Elaho gauge - 30 cms is a good flow to try. If you do run this at higher levels scout\neverything\nbefore dropping in. Getting trapped in one of the canyons is an issue that must be considered - a badly placed piece of wood here could cause a major problem.\nIf you start at the bridge, bushwhack down the river left gully to get to the water. You'll boat some wide open stuff and shortly come to the first canyon - the entrance is unrunnable. What follows are a series of canyons with nice rapids and a wood situation that shifts from year to year. There have been seasons where some sections are completely unrunnable due to wood placement. Perhaps the most impressive part of this run is the canyon below the Dipper Creek confluence, where the water level doubles. In this lower section, you'll eventually reach an obviously unrunnable pile of sieves, which is where most groups hike out to the road (it's a slog, but not a terrible one).\nThe Upper Squamish is fully worth the trip, but maybe just once every other year. There's still a fairly large chunk of river that hasn't been explored above the bridge where you start. If you're doing it as the paddle out from Dipper Creek, the canyons below Dipper are some of the nicest on the Squamish.\nBashing to the put in - Devil's Club sucks even when it's dead.\nSunbathing at the first canyon.\nusquam6.jpg\n469 KB\nusquam7.jpg\n383 KB\nScouting a log choked drop in the second canyon that isn't there any more.\nThird canyon.\nYeah, it's awesome.\nOne of the best rapids of the run, in the lower half.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Building from easy rapids to surging class V and back over its short length, the clear green water and smooth granite combine to give a stretch of river that is rivals most of the other class V runs in the area. Reminiscent of the Bottom Mile of the Ashlu with less gradient and higher volume, this section remains relatively unknown despite being above the popular intermediate stretch of the Statlu/Chehalis. Unfortunately this run is yet another that is under the direct threat of a hydro project which will forever change its wild and beautiful character.\nThe Statlu is a tributary of the Chehalis River. The Chehalis flows into the north side of the Fraser River between the towns of Mission and Harrison Hot Springs. A major logging road ascends the west side of the Chehalis valley - it is well signed for Chehalis Lake where the logging road leaves highway 7. About 15 km up the logging road is a bridge over the Statlu, which is the lowest possible take out for the Canyon.\nThe put in is at the third bridge over the Statlu, 5 km up the Statlu logging road. The third to second bridge section is where the hard whitewater is found. Bridge two to bridge one is essentially an extension of the easier lower Statlu run. Unfortunately the road is often gated just past the first bridge, meaning a 1.5 hour walk to the third bridge put in and paddling out to the first bridge where the cars are parked.\nThe level of the Statlu is visual only. The upstream river left bridge piling at the first Statlu bridge can be used as a visual gauge - 5.5 units showing equates to a perfect medium level. Expect the Statlu to run after rainfall - it should also have a short snowmelt season in early summer. This report was compiled 24 h after a moderate winter rain event with the following gauge peaks:\nChilliwack River above Slesse\n1.7m,\nAlouette River\n0.95m,\nCoquihalla River\n2.8m and\nStave River\n23 cms.\nThe Statlu Canyon starts off as easy but scenic class II-III from the put in bridge. The only indication of the gradient downstream is the very steep shuttle road you drive/hike on the way up there. Things build quickly and you will soon be at the start of the hard whitewater. The rapids are generally blind from above, necessitating bank scouting - portaging is possible but difficult. After a couple of big bouldery rapids the canyon briefly opens up before dropping over the final two rapids.\nThe last two big rapids are set in an incredible location with enormous boulders and colossal log jams lining the banks. The second last rapid is a stand-out double drop that is difficult to scout - it is well worth the effort to do it though. The last rapid is a burly 20 foot waterfall with an easy portage on the left. Below here it is quality class IV, easing to class III just above the second bridge that will be the take out if you can drive the shuttle.\nThe parking lot for the Statlu if the gate is closed.\nConvenient gauge, upstream river left of 1st Statlu bridge.  5 1/2 units showing = perfect medium.\nGetting ready at the put in.\nNice scenery at the start of the canyon.  That is not a bridge, it is a log spanning the river in the background.\nThe first big one - ramp into a hole.\nIn the meat of the run.\nScouting the exit drops.\nLog jam at the exit of the canyon, not in play.\nLooking down on the last major drop - a 20 foot constricted waterfall.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

      "full_text": "BCWhitewater\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nAbout\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact\nBecome a member\nStave River\nWhat It's Like\nStout southwest BC multi-day kayaking.  There's unrealized opportunity to go big in there.\nClass\nV (V+ to VI)\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to long and very difficult.\nTime\n3-4 days.\nWhen to Go\nLate season, August or September.\nGauge\n30.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:00)\n!\nThe Stave River, one of the truly wild rivers of the South Coast area, is a challenging multiday kayak trip not without some significant difficulties that will probably never see a lot of traffic.  The construction of 2 hydro projects on the lower river below Garibaldi Park in 2009 and 2013 have dewatered almost 1/3 of the good whitewater, drastically reducing the whitewater value and detracting from the overall wilderness experience.  Although there are a few release days per year\nprovided by Innergex\n, they are unlikely to be used because there are no public roads accessing the area.  Furthermore, the releases are in May, which is useless for running the multiday option as the upper river will still be snowed in.\nLooking at a map of southwest BC the Stave River drainage stands out like a sore thumb.  Obviously a large river system, it drains Coast Mountain snowmelt from Garibaldi Park directly south to the Fraser River - it's surrounded by the rivers that flow west into Howe Sound or the Squamish River, and on all other sides by the extensive Lillooet River/Harrison Lake drainage.  This is rugged mountain country and there is little record of travel down the Stave River corridor - it's a tough three day trip with excellent whitewater, hard portaging and a lot of potential left to go in and run some serious stuff that hasn't seen a paddle blade.  If you're interested, keep reading to find out what you have to do.\nPlanning a trip in to a river that is impossible to scout beforehand and that has little to no information available about prior descents is always a gamble.  This report is based on a trip that happened on a low snow year, and wanting to be careful of high flows but also not wanting to get stuck on a low water bash-fest we decided that early August would be a good time to go figure out this run.  Space scouting using Google Earth showed a lot of potential for good whitewater, especially in the upper reaches of the river.  We had flows (based on the gauge at Stave Lake) between 20 and 30 cms.  If you are to repeat this trip with the intention of running the big canyons I would go in there with a maximum of 15 cms - maybe even less.  The river can be done in a three day push, but taking four days might be a little more reasonable, especially if you want to consider some of the must-scout-before-running canyons.\nStave flows from this trip, taken from Environment Canada, Stave River above Stave Lake gauge.\nAccess to the Stave put in is by float plane only - the country here is wild and rough with no road access in the upper valley - the fact that no roads have penetrated the upper watershed is most likely because the river lies in Garibaldi Park.  The instant you cross the park boundary there is a road along the river and the valley is heavily clear cut.  We flew out of Whistler with\nWhistler Air\nto the small lake below the Stave Glacier.  The flight is nothing short of spectacular.  Whether or not Whistler Air (now Harbor Air, new ownership) will still fly here is unknown.\nThe Cessna Caravan we flew in with Whistler Air.\nAnd the motley crew - Cory, Steve, Max and Matt.\nJust one of the spectacular vistas on the flight in - there is ice everywhere up there.\nA late evening landing on the put in lake.\nThere are a few more options when it comes to taking off the river.  We opted for the float plane pick up from Stave Lake, flying back to Whistler.  This was in the interest of time and convenience.  Although there is a road paralleling the lower river, you can only get to this road by taking a boat across Stave Lake.  The south end of Stave Lake is near the town of Mission, so if you're motivated to paddle out or are industrious enough to arrange a boat to pick you up at the north end of the lake when you finish the river it will save some money on the flight, but it won't save any time.  Note that if you do opt to fly out you'll have to paddle a few kilometres down the lake - there are a lot of dead trees poking out of the water (the lake was dammed to raise the level) in the north end making landing a plane impossible.\nThe first few kilometers of the river (down to the trifluence of the Stave with a big river left and a small river right tributary) is splashy, easy whitewater.  If you choose the three day option it might be a good idea to fly in around supper time and paddle through this stuff, camping just below the side creeks and above the first canyon.  The first canyon is obvious and it has a gravel bar just upstream that's a nice camp site - it'll give you a chance to scout out the first rapids as well.  Incidentally, the first two creeks you just passed are the only major tributaries that enter the river, and from your first paddle strokes you'll probably have 80 % of the volume that you'll have at the lake, 45 km downstream.\nPacking up for day 1.\nDay one was the best day of our trip.  Immediately from camp we dropped into an ultra classic canyon that was all runnable.  It's scoutable with some climbing up the walls, but portaging wouldn't be easy.  Everyone was fired up and spirits were high after we paddled out from this one, hoping the rest of the river would be the same.  Next up was a huge one-off rapid that saw one descent by our crew, followed by many miles of open valley with good scenery and awesome class IV-V boating, again all runnable.  A good ending for day one is at the start of the second canyon - be careful here, you don't want to drop in!  A quick scout will let you know you're reached it - it starts with a gnarly waterfall leading into a vertical walled canyon.\nWelcome to the Stave!  Early on in the first canyon.\nSteve Bartrom in the midst of it all - this photo really expresses the character of the canyon.\nOne of the last rapids of the first canyon.\nThe giant rapid after the canyon - the crux is just out of the bottom of the frame.\nSoaking up the awesome mountain scene.\nOne of the rapids of the open valley section.\nDownstream view of the top part of the second canyon, taken from the lip of the entrance falls.\nThe first half of our second day was all portaging.  The initial portion of the second canyon at our levels was class V+ to VI. If this section is runnable at low flows it will be extremely high consequence.  The canyon briefly opens before plunging over a series of huge waterfalls.  The whole river thunders over two smaller falls and then over a 70 footer that pounds onto rock.  This directly goes over another waterfall into a black crack in the earth that you can't see the bottom of.  There's good camping on river right at the falls.\nStaring down the awesome (awesome, but not runnable) falls - the river is plunging into the death crack at the bottom.\nThe waterfalls - there are several more out of the frame and around the corners.\nBig portaging.\nThe portage is on the right, and down to the falls is flat walking through semi thick forest.  You'll have to walk around the falls and on downstream where the dark chasm opens again into a wider but still huge canyon.  At the falls a creek comes in on the right that can be crossed by walking upstream to a decent pool.  Past the creek is some thick bushwhacking through a winter avalanche path followed by walking across a steep talus slope.  It's hard going, but there is little elevation change on the walk.  The canyon continues and it may be possible to go to the edge and find a way in - it will need to be scouted and will likely need some rope work to get down to the water.  We opted to continue to the bottom of this canyon - continue along the talus and into the forest where it is an easy, if a little steep walk through old growth down to the water.  There's a 40 foot slide at the exit of the canyon that you can get to the top of.  This whole portage took us about 4 hours.\nThe Stave undergoes a dramatic transformation at the end of the second canyon.  The valley opens up with good downstream vistas and the whitewater changes from bedrock canyon to steep boulder rapids formed by massive landslides.  This section is furiously steep, and while we were able to pick away at it, it would come in to prime at much lower water.  There is nice camping after the last big rapid in this section.\nMore big portaging in the boulders.\nA big slide - no takers because of high water.\nRunning amongst the boulders.\nAfter the boulders the river eases to flat water - in the distance you can see clear cutting, meaning the road is close.  The whitewater however is far from over - soon comes the final canyon of the Stave that starts with a perfect 30 foot waterfall.  We portaged right (1.5 hours) because it was blown out too high - this canyon has a huge rapid in the middle that might make the canyon unrunnable - if you get in there, scout the whole thing first as there is little option to escape after the first waterfall.  This canyon is now dewatered for hydro power.\nAfter this canyon there is still some good stuff left - the lower section can loosely be described as class IV-IV+ with a few waterfalls thrown in for good measure.  The road parallels the river in this lower stretch (the lower 25 km) so scouting and portaging is quite easy, especially when compared to the upper stretches of the river.  Unfortunately the best portion of the lower river has been dewatered for a run-of-river hydro project and when the upper river is runnable the diversion reach will be dry.  You read correctly - there are 2 hydro projects on the Stave.  There is potential for recreational whitewater flow release here - the project is currently owned by Innergex.\nSome relatively chilled but fun stuff below the canyons.\nDam.  This part was a surprise, and it sucked.\nBig construction happening on the Stave.\nThe section to be dewatered from our roadside scout.\nAfter the powerhouse there is almost no whitewater left on the river, and the occasional small rapids fade to current and finally flat water.  The scenery is epic with tall granite walls on all sides as you approach Stave Lake.  Once you get to the lake, do whatever you have to do to get yourself back to the civilized world.\nAny trip down the Stave should still be considered exploratory. I feel the trip would be worthwhile even with the dams in operation, but the third day would have little whitewater once the second project is finished.  The first day of the trip was as classic as anything around - the real test of this river will be when someone goes in at lower flows and assesses the runnability of the big canyons on day 2 and figures out the rest of the big avalanche rapids that follow.  If it's all runnable, the Stave has the potential to become a world-class class V multi day kayaking trip.\nStave River Trivia\nThe first known descent on the Stave happened some time in the 90's.  A short account of their run disappeared with the defunct Fraser Valley Whitewater web page.\nWe found the remains of a raft in the woods near the start of the first canyon.  A good story I'm sure.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Far from a classic, the Stawamus is a short section of boogie water with easy access that offers a fun option to get out paddling when things in the area are high or flooding. While most of this section is made up of fast, continuous class III rapids, there is a long class V rapid in the middle that is hard to find without unfortunately placed wood. There is undoubtedly more whitewater to explore upstream of what is described here!\nThe Stawamus is accessed along the Mamquam Forest Service Road which you find on the south end of Squamish underneath the Chief. A bridge over the Stawamus about 2 km from the highway is the take out. You can continue kayaking downstream a little further but it quickly becomes flat and choked with wood - if you do this just walk back up along the river. About 500 m up from the bridge is a large junction of logging roads - park here and walk behind the water treatment building to access the river. The large class V rapid is just upstream from this parking area - if it's not runnable (wood) or you don't want to run it just start wherever looks best behind the building. There is an extensive network of trails along the river.\nThe Stawamus has an\nEnvironment Canada online gauge\n. 2.40 m is a medium flow. Expect water levels to change quickly on this small creek. The lower section is runnable at high water, up until you decide you can't find a place to stop.\nThe easiest section of the Stawamus is from behind the water treatment building at the junction down to the bridge, or just below. Expect boogie water with no standout rapids that you can scout by walking along the river. If you're interested in the bigger class V rapid, walk up the gated road behind the building until you reach a small dam and the end of the road. A few easy rapids lead towards the big rapid. This rapid starts with a fantastic 10 foot boof. There are few eddies in this rapid, and if it's free of wood it's an exciting one to fire up. You can start at several points along this rapid if it's not good from the top.\nThe last part of the big rapid.  Most of the lower run looks like (or is easier than) the rapids in the foreground of this photo.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Expect a lot of portages caused by wood.\nClass\nIV-IV+, V at high water\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to difficult - the full spectrum.\nTime\n2-4 days.\nWhen to Go\nJuly-August.\nThe accessiblity of the Stein is now in question after a change of ownership at Whistler Air, now Harbour Air. They will no longer land a plane on Stein Lake, consistent with the non-motorized status of the Stein Valley Park. This is a real loss for the community as the Stein, a relatively moderate multiday trip, is otherwise only accessible by spending 2 days hiking into and then paddling the much more difficult\nNorth Stein\n.\nIt is our view that the Stein should be made available as a fly in multiday trip for kayakers by special permit. There is a legitmate need for non-motorized areas in southwest BC, however the opportunity for multiday kayak trips is exceedingly rare in this area. The loss of access to the upper Stein is part of an ongoing trend of dimishing river access in southwest BC, largely driven by hydro development and deteriorating forest service roads. Surely a system can be put in place to responsibly manage limited float plane access for the purpose of a whitewater kayaking trip. Even at the height of its popularity, the Stein saw, at most, one or two descents per season.\nThe Stein River is one of the original classic southwest BC fly in multi day kayak trips. Running from the heart of the Coast Mountains east to the Fraser River, the Stein passes through several distinct ecosystems over its 50 km length. This river system is protected as the\nStein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park\n, and it remains in pristine condition with no development aside from a hiking trail through the valley. It is a trip worth doing, though it's something you might not want to do every season. While the whitewater is good, particularly through the last third of the river, there are some long flat sections and there tends to be a lot of wood that results in a significant amount of portaging.\nThe Stein accommodates a range of levels. The normal season is in July and August. Typically the earlier you go the higher the water will be. Early season runs are limited by ice on the lake. Appropriate for grade IV boaters with support at low levels, the Stein is generally seen as a IV-V run if you go early in July. At comparable levels it is a half-step easier than the\nClendinning\n. Strong teams looking for more adventure might want to consider putting in on the\nNorth Stein\n(a burly hike in run that drops into the Stein just below the lake).\nPutting in on the Stein used to be easy. Whistler Air used to fly to Stein Lake, but they will no longer land there - you will have to get creative with your access plan, or hike in to the North Stein. The take out is at the confluence of the Stein and Fraser Rivers, near the town of Lytton. There are multiple locations where you can leave vehicles, including but not limited to the Stein Valley Park trailhead, the Lytton cable ferry crossing, or further down the Fraser at its confluence with the Thompson. The drive from Whistler to Lytton over the Duffy Lake road takes 3-4 hours.\nTiming the length of your trip on the Stein can be awkward if you want good campsites each night. Strong, fast groups can push through in 2 days, which is typical for those entering via the North Stein (not including the hike in and the paddle down to the main Stein). Groups looking for a relaxed trip, or those who will need a lot of time to scout and portage, will do well taking 4 days, and excellent camping will be available every night. Three days is most common, but it can be challenging to find good camping on the first night without taking a short or long first day on the water.\nStein Lake is an idyllic place to land a float plane. Unfortunately the river is essentially unrunnable because of log jams from the outlet of the lake down to the confluence with the North Stein (about 1.5 km). Thankfully there is a good but strenuous hiking trail on river right so bushwhacking isn't required. Don't drop down to the water until you are sure you've reached the North Stein confluence!\nThe first real whitewater you encounter will be a series of nice slides followed by a section of flat water. You should find wood portages almost right away. Expect many of the log jams to be mobile from season to season - some years are better than others. If you decide to continue past the flat water into the next section of rapids you will not find good camping for a long time. This section of whitewater is the most committing of the run, with the trail being far away from the water. This section is often referred to as 'the canyon'.\nThe steep valley walls of 'the canyon' gradually give way, as does the intensity of the rapids. This middle section of the run is largely flat water and two massive log jam portages. The first portage is best on the right, through the forest, and it isn't too bad. The second portage is around a terrible mess of log jams and river braids. It is not nice. The best option here is to portage through the old burnt out forest on the left side. Below the log jams the flat water continues. The start of the final and best section of the river is signified by passing under a large foot bridge.\nThe final 15 km of the run is absolutely classic read and run whitewater. About half way through is a large class V rapid called Devils Staircase that can be portaged at river level on the right or left. The lower Stein from Devils Staircase down is a popular hike in day trip.

Big canyon.\nTime\n2-3 hours\nWhen to Go\nAll summer.\nGauge\n218.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:40)\n!\nSandwiched between the Grand Canyon of the Stikine (V) and the Lower Stikine (I-II), the Tahltan to Telegraph section is a surprisingly accessible way to experience the Stikine River on a half day trip. You can even tell your friends that you paddled the canyons of the Stikine, if you go light on details. Even though this run is technically roadside, neither the road nor buildings are visible from the river. The spectacular canyon also has potential for mountain goat viewing.\nFlows\nInformation for this description is based on flows of 250-500cms (Stikine River at Telegraph Creek). The section is likely runnable higher, although boils could become an issue, as well as other high water risks. Also, locals say the river doesn't freeze much in winter anymore, so off season low water descents may be possible as well.\nShuttle\nThe run is located about 2 hours west of Dease Lake on the Telegraph Creek Road (BC Highway 51). The put in is at the confluence of the Tahltan and Stikine Rivers. This is an important cultural and fishing site for the Tahltan, so be respectful. The takeout is a further 20km downstream at the town of Telegraph Creek. The Riversong Cafe in Telegraph Creek may be able to provide a shuttle service, and also has camping, meals and accommodation. The run could be extended another 20km of flatwater down to Glenora, where the road ends.\nOn the water\nMuch of the run is in a steep sided, craggy and loose canyon. At normal levels the whitewater is pretty straightforward class II-III wave trains and boily eddies, as well as a fair amount of flatwater. A couple of the bigger rapids are on left bends. For comparison, the volume and style of the whitewater is similar to the Thompson River, but a half grade easier. Keep an eye out for a nice waterfall at Seven Mile Creek. The Water Survey gauge cable is about 1km above the takeout at Telegraph Creek.\nLooking downstream at the Tahltan and Stikine Rivers. Put in on the gravel bar at the confluence.\n\"Eagle Rock\" in basalt columns above the confluence, an important site for the Tahltan Nation.\nOne of the bigger rapids on a left bend, viewed from the shuttle.\nThe same rapid at river level.\nSeven Mile Creek waterfall.\nThe rapids are easy but portaging would not be.\nTowards the end of the canyon.\nTelegraph Creek takeout.\nDowntown Telegraph Creek.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The big drops are walkable.\nTime\n2-3 hours.\nWhen to Go\nMay-July in normal years.\nSt. Leon Creek is a tiny drainage on the east shore of Upper Arrow Lake between Revelstoke and Nakusp that was first discovered just a few years ago. Small and manky looking at the take out bridge, this run has several miles of hectic boogie water studded with several big, high quality bedrock drops. While this run isn't really appropriate for class IV or even IV+ boaters because of the limited eddies above, and the speed at which the big drops appear out of the boogie water, it is an excellent run with some standout big rapids not to be missed.\nLevels on the St. Leon are visual only. There is a photo on the bottom of this page that references a medium-high water level. At this level the big rapids were well padded out with only 1 hole to really be worried about, and the boogie was fast and just slightly manky. Higher water would go just fine with cleaner, faster boogie and the development of some worrisome holes at the big rapids. Lower water would mean bigger hits and bad mank in the boogie. Expect this river to be in the good range in June/July in a normal snow year.\nTake out access is at the highway 23 bridge over the river just before it pours into Upper Arrow Lake. This is found about 15 minutes south of the Galena Bay ferry (it's free, and you have to take it to get from Revelstoke to the river), which is in turn about 1 hour south of Revelstoke. The put in is found on the south logging road, which turns off highway 23 approximately 1 km south of the river. Follow the mainline of this logging road for a short distance until an obvious spur falls off and down to the left into a large clearcut. Park at the end of this spur, hike 100 m upstream and then go straight down to the water.\u00a0 Note:\nthe put in access presented here might be inaccurate\n.\nDepending on how far up the river you hiked, the first major rapid comes either immediately or very quickly. It's a triple drop - boof, boof, slide. Boogie rolls right out of the bottom of this one. Keep a sharp eye out for wood as if there is something bad in play it will come quickly and eddies are few. The second big rapid - a very tall slide - comes at a left bend with small eddies on the right to stop and scout. More of the same continues until the last major rapid. Starting with a narrow canyon that's often filled with wood necessitating a portage on a good trail on river right, the river then plunges over a super clean 25ish foot falls followed by some bedrock ledges. The spot to scout/portage is often marked with flagging tape - the canyon entrance is not immediately obvious. There is a good eddy to seal launch into just above the falls. Once the river turns back to boogie, it's just a few corners down to take out bridge.\nThe ride across Upper Arrow Lake to reach St. Leon from Revelstoke.\nFirst big rapid on St. Leon, the middle of 3 drops.\nThe triple drop, with heavy glare, from below.

The day we ran this the Chilliwack Canyon was at 1.65 and dropping after heavy rain a few days before.\nThere is an Upper Tamihi Creek section above this which is currently undocumented but apparently is worth a visit too, class IV+ / V.\nGauge rock highlighted here\nOn the drive up Tamihi FSR currently (February 2024) any 4WD can get up, it's muddy, a few shallow water-bars and there are rock-slides in places but a Subaru made it to the put-in, take the right fork about 2km.\u00a0 Along the drive you divert away from the river and gain quite a considerable height, eventually coming back to river-level and getting to pre-scout some rapids and spot some wood probably.\u00a0 Hiking off this river towards the later half would be particularly arduous. The lines feel very class 4 to 4+ in places but the consequences are high throughout this river.\u00a0 There is one mandatory portage and expect wood. Most rapids are easily scoutable and you can portage the harder stuff if you really wanted to. That'll be enough info for you to have your own adventure, read on for the full beta.\nThe river at the put-on, a large tree is blocking the channel just downstream.\nStarting at the bridge about 7km up, we were a bit intimidated by the mankiness of the rapids upstream and immediately downstream (with some wood blocking the river too).\u00a0 We put-on a little further downstream, the first couple of rapids were steep and hard to read and run.\u00a0 It seems from older reports that groups put in a little further down which would avoid the hasty first paddle-strokes.\nAlsek Watt boofing the early drops\nWe got out and scout as frequently as possible, at the first island split we headed right which looks a nicer line.\u00a0 The eddies on this river aren't very big so suggest a group size of 3-4 maximum, or keep very far apart eddy-hopping.\nTypical early tight boulder garden\nWood is a major problem on this river, the first few km were manky boulder bashing, shallow with the occasional nice boof. The river eventually started to clean-up, but our trip was punctuated by river-wide trees or small branches making clean-lines dirty, despite this it is well worth doing as we started to get rewarded with nicer rapids and long sections where you can easily read and run for several hundred meters at a time.\nA small island signaled the start of the canyon section with a lovely clean entrance rapid.\nStart of the real fun\nSadly the next rapid which had a lot of very sharp shale rock from a landslide (beware of gouging your boat eddying out) has a huge old-growth log which shan't be moving for a very long time stuck down the middle of it (has been there 14 years so far).\u00a0 Easy portage left.\nA large blocking what would otherwise be a fun boof drop!\nThe river now has much steeper sides and blind corners, after a few reasonably easy read-and-run rapids we came across a medium sized log-jam which may blow out with enough water eventually, we were able to sneak by the left side of it.\nAlsek Watt charging over some shallow rocks to sneak around the wood.\nOne of the next rapid on a wide right bend is worth inspecting as it's just before the portage, a short steep entrance, an undercut boulder on the left and some holes at the bottom, almost read and run, eddy out before the obvious horizon line with old growth in it.\nThe portage 'weir drop' with very large old growth in it (picture Thomas Woelfing)\nThere is a reasonably established trailer up a short bank, which takes you to a ridge, you can't really get a view into the rapid you are portaging but note it drops somewhere between 30-50ft\u00a0 around the bend.\u00a0 A group in\u00a0 2024 left a rope to help make the surprisingly long descent easier, the next rapid also had a lot of large old growth in it which will be there for a while so we put on below that after probably portaging 200m of river.\u00a0 Watch out for devils club.\nThe first rapid after the portage, cleaner than it looks from this photo.\nThe next set of rapids are beautifully clean, the sort of rapids you'd expect on the Upper Cheakamus, and without the mank/portaging above would make this run one of the absolute best in the Lower Mainland. Enjoy your reward for the suffering, the last 1km is fantastic, as the river bends become less sharp you'll notice the canyon opening up and all of a sudden you'll be at the take-out bridge which has a lovely clean set of drops in its own right.\nThe last 1km of fun read and run Class IV as seen from the air.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Also visual rock gauge at take out.\nGauge: Look for the Chilliwack to be around 1.5 meters on the \u201cChilliwack River above Slesse Creek\u201d gauge at the environment Canada site. That should give you a rough idea of when it will be going. Once you\u2019re at the creek there is a large flat table rock just upstream of the lowest bridge. No water over the rock is to low, water just covering the entire rock is a medium-low, if you can\u2019t see the rock or it is making a hole then it\u2019s high. The lower run can handle more water than the upper.\nYou may be able to drive to the put-in again now, which may have been at the 2nd bridge you will come to driving up....You will come to the second bridge (on the run) over some class 5+ woody mank. The old take out was just up stream of this shortly after the steep hill.\nThere is a solid class 5 piece that is optional near the end of this run a short ways upstream of the 2nd bridge. Scout the last eddy carefully if you decide to run this lower piece as missing the eddy would send you into the class 6 log choked boulder mess under the bridge.\nNotes: This run is incredible and beautiful. On a sunny summer day with the crystal clear water and lush surroundings it\u2019s easy to forget you\u2019re in the Chilliwack River Valley, it\u2019s totally different from everything else in the valley.\nSome years this run is full of wood, and other years it only has. . . a lot of wood.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Waterfalls, slides, electric blue water and difficult access.\nClass\nV\nScouting / Portaging\nDifficult to virtually impossible.  One common portage requires ropes to lower boats and down climb.\nTime\n4-6 hours.\nWhen to Go\nLate season run, usually in August.\nGauge\n3.29cms\u2191 (Feb 14 11:44)\n!\nThe access roads to Tatlow have been steadily deteriorating for years, and as of 2017 you can no longer drive anywhere close to the river. In 2016, it was found that large parts of the old Ashlu logging road were finally destroyed by flooding and avalanches, and in 2017 the bridge over the Ashlu at 50/50 was closed permanently. Now the best access is to drive up to the dam, paddle across the lake and hike up the old logging road. It is a 10 km walk to the Tatlow spur road, on the badly damaged Ashlu Main. Until this valley gets logged again, Tatlow is out of business unless you're highly motivated to hike.\nYou don't need to look hard to find stories and photos of Tatlow Creek - for good reason. Despite deteriorating access roads, Tatlow Creek remains one of the most sought after class V river trips in the area for its ultra classic waterfalls and slides, electric blue water and dramatic mountain scenery. On top of the truly outstanding rapids, Tatlow Creek is a full day of adventure with a 4x4 approach, a big bushwhack to the river and usually some tricky portaging.\nTatlow is a late snowmelt run, usually in the month of August. However, good flows can sometimes happen in July when the snowpack is weak and well in to September in heavy snow years. There is no online gauge; levels are visual only and we have no good correlation to other gauges. A good visual gauge is the rock in the middle of the river immediately above the final 1 foot drop into the take out pool. If this rock is dry the river is low. If this rock has an inch or two of water spilling over the top it is medium. If this rock is making a hole, tread carefully as the water is high.\nTatlow is a tributary of the Ashlu. To get there drive up the Ashlu valley. You have to either park at the decomissioned bridge at the\nBox Canyon\nput in and walk up to Tatlow on the river left road, or you can drive further up towards the dam, paddle across the lake and hike from there. Just over 10 km past the dam there will be a spur road breaking off to the left which leads to a bad washout and a rotting bridge over the Ashlu. As of 2017 the road past the dam is overgrown and badly damaged with some very rough spots - even if you could get a vehicle past 50/50, it wouldn't be passable any more.\nAfter crossing the Ashlu on the Tatlow spur the old road forks. Taking the left fork brings you to the take out pool where you can check the level. The right fork is an old grown over logging road that you hike up to reach the put in. The hike is pretty much straight up hill the whole way. Without a guide the pseudo-trail to the put in can be hard to find. Start bushwhacking down to the river when the heavily overgrown road opens up to give you an expansive view of the valley. The most important landmark to reach the good put in is a small creek that drops into Tatlow on the far side of the valley - where this creek joins Tatlow is the exact location of the best put in.\nThe action starts quickly from the put in with some boogie leading into the first waterfall series. Pool drop bedrock waterfalls and rapids continue for a short distance. Following the twisty bedrock rapid is some solid boogie above a common portage. Watch carefully for a bend to the left with a horizon line and a small river right eddy. This rapid (sometimes runnable) is usually portaged on river right - the path is obvious but you will need a 70 foot throwbag/rope to lower boats and climb down on.\nBelow the portage is the crux section of the river with several stacked big rapids that are difficult to scout. The order goes Wall Drug/pillow boof/40 foot slide with a stout entrance/log waterfall. Portaging in this section is extremely difficult. The ability to get out to scout or portage (throw-n-go) the log drop is one of the high water limiting factors on this run. After the log waterfall the intensity backs off but the run remains challenging right until the spectacular take out pool. Having successfully descended Tatlow Creek, enjoy one of the best take outs you'll find anywhere and be fired up to chill out in such a wild place!\nThe old rotting bridge over the Ashlu.\nAt the end of the road.\nThe fantastic view down Tatlow and out into the Ashlu valley.\nThe start of the bushwhack from the old road down to the river.\nA wrecked boat at the put in, presumably from being buried in snow after being left over the winter.

Interesting scenery.\nClass\nIII, big water.\nScouting / Portaging\nEasy to moderate - far enough from the road that walking out would be difficult.\nTime\n2-5 hours.\nWhen to Go\nAll year.  Best season is in August-October.\nGauge\n280.0cms\u2193 (Oct 21 05:20)\n!\nThe Thompson is a huge river that drains a large portion of the southern interior of BC, flowing in to the Fraser at the town of Lytton. From a kayaking perspective it is a fun big volume grade III run that is most popular in the late summer and early fall (relatively low water), with several nice play features. The rapids are a great place to challenge intermediates with a good roll, and it's a relaxing trip for stronger boaters. The scenery is very impressive but not exactly natural. The river corridor is home to the main cross-country rail lines for both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific, as well as the Trans Canada Highway. Expect to see many trains!\nGetting to the Thompson couldn't be easier. All roads around the river are paved highways. Lytton (the take out town) is about 3.5 hours from Vancouver. Access to the river is at a public boat launch just above a large rail bridge on the Fraser (river left) a few hundred meters below the confluence. The road to the boat lauch is next to the Visitor Information Center in town. The put in is about 15 km east on highway 1. Look for an obvious ravine and a boat lauch used for raft access. There is ample parking just west of the boat launch.\nThere is an\naccurate online gauge\nfor the Thompson. While the river is runnable at any level, it is most popular for kayakers at relatively low water in the late summer and early fall. At this time of year the river is big volume grade III appropriate for intermediates with a strong roll. It can be run at any level earlier in the summer, just expect the boily nature of such a big river (2000+ cms at high water) to increase the difficulty and consequence accordingly. There are probably many play waves that come and go due to the huge fluctuations in flow over the course of a season.\nThings are relatively calm at the put in. Just a few hundred meters below the start is the Frog Wave. This is a decent play feature that is best around 450 cms. It is possible to park and play here. The biggest rapids are in the first few kilometers, including Witch's Cauldron, Cutting Board (go left at the island) and Jaws. Jaws is located where the highway starts to go far away from the river, and it's possible to put in here to miss the biggest rapids. Below Jaws the river mellows noticably, and there are some sections of flat water. Keep an eye out for some good on the fly surfing. You'll know you've reached the take out when one last grade III wavetrain appears just above the bridges in Lytton.\nView\nThompson\nin a larger map\nA common sight on the Thompson - a large rafting crew leaving the put in and heading for the Frog.  The high water mark is clearly visible.\nThe Frog wave.\nMore trains than kayakers pass through this canyon.\nScouting one of the bigger rapids - most of the shoreline where you would want to scout is infested with broken, loose rock.\nRunning the left line at Cutting Block.\nGrand scenery on the lower stretch of the river - the wind eroded cliffs and rail infrastructure make for a unique setting.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

One of the other biggest rapids on the run gets very tricky (maybe impossible) to portage at high water\nTime\nFull day to show yourself down for the first time, half day if you know it.\nWhen to Go\nLater in the summer as water levels come down. Usually a later July to early August run, but can come in at other times.\nThis run is an absolute classic. It fits between Skookumchuck creek and the harder runs like Yoho and Spillimacheen in terms of difficulty and is a great stepping stone to running class V whitewater. The length of run and difficulty of egress once into the canyons can create difficulties for those who are really pushing their comfort level on class IV/IV+.\nThe 7 canyons of Toby creek is a long run with a huge amount of clean, fun rapids that range in character from boulder gardens to constricted canyons. The run starts off quite open and has long boulder garden rapids with fun boofs and eddies to play around in. It picks up gradient before entering any canyons and has one steeper rapid formed by large boulders that is about as difficult as any of the rapids downstream (except Smittys, the often portaged class V rapid). At this point the road is only a few hundred meter scramble up a steep bank, and anyone who is not feeling confident about another 10km+ of similar difficulty whitewater can exit here. After this point exiting the river is quite difficult.\nThere are too many rapids to give anything like a detailed description, however there are a few things to keep an eye out for.\nOne of the early canyons starts with a rapid called Juniors that has a narrow entrance with an undercut/siphon on the right at the top of the rapid and a typewriter wave that pushes toward the undercut.\nAbout halfway down is Smittys. The river enters a narrow, fairly straight canyon with a few drops that are on the edge of being comfortable to boat-scout before taking a right turn and dropping away into stacked rapids with some big holes that you definitely do not want to run blind. The stacked up section is called Smittys and changes frequently. Usually it goes a bit smoother than it looks like it will. Scouting and portaging are done on river left. This is accomplished by making your way up a steep rock slab and then across scree and large rocks before deciding where you want to put back in.\nOne of the final rapids on the run begins with a 3-4 foot boof followed by some continuous whitewater before finishing with another 3-4 foot boof with an ugly pocket on the right. At high water it becomes very difficult to portage the last and most intimidating part of this rapid. After this is Purple Haze (named for the purple coloured rocks in the canyon walls) and a landslide rapid that is still settling. These last couple of rapids have been changing significantly over recent years so stay on the lookout for ugly new features.\nThe runout treats you to beautiful views of hoodoos and ... interesting views of 2 separate canyons that people used to roll old, broken vehicles down to get rid of them.\nFlows\nSince there is no online gauge or stick gauge it is a little tricky to know when this river is in. If it looks well within its banks, clear and even a little bony in the flatter/wider parts that you can see from the road it is most likely in. If it looks really bony it probably is. If it looks fast and full then it is almost certainly too high. The level is easier to tell from the put in than the takeout since it is so wide and meandering at the takeout.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The minumum flow is 15 cms on BROWNS RIVER NEAR COURTENAY (08HB026). This gauge is in a different watershed so is only an approximation. The waterfall will be better higher, maybe around 50cms (see pictures below). For the lower run, the only high water limiting factor is the significant wood hazard.\nShuttle\nThe trail to scout the waterfall is located just south of Cumberland on Highway 19, on the north side of the bridge (river left). There are small pullouts on either side of the freeway, but they come up quick at 110km/h. The trail leaves the highway about 200m north of the bridge, follow it about 400m downstream on river left to the waterfall. The put in for the lower run is at the base of the waterfall, ropework may be needed to lower boats.\nTo get to the takeout, head north on Highway 19 for 4km and take the exit for Cumberland. Turn left onto Cumberland Road, left again on Union Road, and left again onto Royston Road. Follow Royston Road over the highway and all the way down to the beach, where there are several parking options. Another takeout option is the abandoned railway bridge in Royston, this is a bit of a hike from either Cameron Road or Hatton Road.\nOn the water\nThe put in for the waterfall can either be at the highway or from a branch off the scouting trail.\nThe waterfall is a bumpy slide into a freefall, in total about 15m high. Supposedly the landing is softer on river left where most of the current is.\nBelow the waterfall is a beautiful canyon with huge maple and fir trees. It even has a few friendly surf waves with eddy service, amongst creeky class III whitewater. Unfortunately, where the channel braids out there is lots of wood in play. The run is not terminally congested with wood, but be on the lookout to encounter riverwide logs in a few surprising and dangerous spots. Despite being close to town, this is a rugged canyon that would be difficult to exit in places.\nPaddle out to the ocean and turn left to takeout on the seashore in Royston. Taking out earlier at the abandoned train bridge may skip a couple log jams.\nTrent River Falls (15cms on BROWNS RIVER NEAR COURTENAY 08HB026).

Everything else can be figured out near river level.\nTime\n4 hours\nWhen to Go\nMay-June, after peak freshet\nGauge\n0.03cms\u2193 (Oct 21 04:15)\n!\nWhere else can you boof granite drops, kick it at the beach, and then go wine tasting on shuttle? Trout Creek feels surprisingly wild considering how close it is to Summerland. And while there are several clean bedrock rapids, this run will never be a classic due to the wood situation and a healthy dose of mank. It's worth doing if you're into exploring microcreeks, but probably just once.\nThe Okanagan creeking flow window is indeed fleeting, and you're most likely to catch this one in May or June, after peak freshet but before flows dry up. The best way to gauge flows is to go to the Trout Creek Trestle in Summerland. If the canyon under the trestle looks reasonable, the rest of the run should be fine too. There is an online gauge on a tributary high up in the watershed; a flow of 0.4cms on that gauge equated to an acceptable low flow (CAMP CREEK AT MOUTH NEAR THIRSK (08NM134)). The Ashnola gauge might also give clues as to what is happening in the region. While more flow would probably be more fun, you'll need to catch many small or nonexistent eddies above riverwide wood.\nShuttle is pretty straightforward: put in at the Summerland Rodeo Grounds, and take out at Sun-Oka Beach Provincial Park on Okanagan Lake. Walking or biking the shuttle is actually quite pleasant, by using the road to the Summerland Ornamental Gardens and the Kettle Valley Rail Trail.\nOn the river, you'll spend most of the time boat scouting and keeping an eye peeled for wood. There are a few narrow canyons and tight bedrock drops in the 1-2m range; you can get a decent look at them from near river level. Where the river canyons up, some of the drops are surprisingly fun for a creek of 5-10cms. Where it opens up into a bouldery riverbed, it's pretty mediocre. The rapids are really more in the class III-IV range. The IV+ rating is just due to catching microeddies above wood, a few pinny rapids, and some canyon commitment factor. In 2020, in addition to ~10 river wide logs, there was one large riverwide logjam, as well as a known landslide near the Summerland Golf and Country Club. Some of the jankiest rapids are actually the two just downstream of the trestle. Paddling out to the lake makes for a unique finish.\nScouting the crux canyon from the Trout Creek Trestle, which is also a good place to get a feel for the level.\nEarly on in the run.\nPeeking around a corner.\nOne of several small bedrock drops.\nHigh water runs may not be such a good idea.\nDropping into the tight canyon under the trestle.\n.\nTake out on Okanagan Lake.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The road was built for the abandoned Cassiar asbestos mine, and despite industrial litter the valley is still spectacular. Health risks are possibly present, but keep in mind the risk from asbestos is inhaling the dust/fibers. The mill is inactive and most of the run is kilometers away.\nDownstream of the upper float is a dramatic change into Stoutline Creek, possibly waiting for a first descent?\nFlows\nTroutline Creek is probably best in early summer, as it is near the headwaters in an unglaciated area. June is probably best for the easy float through the upper valley. Sometime later in the summer, the lower canyons should drop into a reasonable flow, but they probably get too low at some point.\nThe nearest gauge is in a different watershed, but may be helpful for estimating flows (COTTONWOOD RIVER ABOVE BASS CREEK (10AC005)). A flow of ~75cms on this gauge correlated to enough water for the upper float on Troutline Creek, although the lower canyons looked a bit high and were not paddled.\nHistorical Max/Min/Mean Hydrometric Data Graph for COTTONWOOD RIVER ABOVE BASS CREEK (10AC005) [BC]. From a different drainage, but may represent flow conditions in the region.\nShuttle\nThis semi-roadside section is located about 2 hours north of Dease Lake along the road to the abandoned mining town of Cassiar. The take out for the lower canyons is located on the outskirts of Jade City. To get to the put in, drive 2km NE on Highway 37, turn left onto the Cassiar Road, and zero your tripmeter. After ~5.7km, the first bridge is over Quartzrock Creek, but keep going as this creek doesn't look good to go. At ~7.3km, a spur road on the left leads 300m to an intermediate access point on Troutline Creek, which can be used to split the run between the upper class II float and lower class V canyons. At ~12.8km from the highway, a giant pile of asbestos mine tailings will come into view, and a quick left turn towards the airstrip will have a couple put in options.\nOn the water\nPutting on near the airstrip, Troutline Creek is a novelty ~5km class I-II float through subapline meadows that should take under an hour. The road is never too far away in this upper section. Make sure to scout a take out point if you are not planning to continue into the lower canyons.\nDrone flights of the lower canyons showed a few class V (?) drops of varying quality, although flows looked a bit on the high side at ~75cms on COTTONWOOD RIVER ABOVE BASS CREEK (10AC005) in early July 2022. If you have information or photos of running this section feel free to send them in. A successful descent of this lower canyon section of Troutline Creek would mostly be a coincidence of a crew happening to be in the area during the presumably narrow window of appropriate flows.

The canyon is super stacked and nonstop.\nScouting Double Tap from above\nIt starts off Double Tap which is a cool drop with an island in the middle and on river left there is a double drop sort of thing (10-12 ft tall). On river right there is a waterfall (10-12 ft ) into a tight slot that is doable, but you would need to be very on line.\nRiver right side of Double Tap\nLucas Hately running Double Tap\nThis is followed by a small slide hole boogie rapid. The next horizon line is slippery hotdog which also has two options, on river left there is a series of 2 smaller slides, and on river right there is a stout drop/slide. It is possible to scout or portage both channels from the center island might be hard to get on the island when the water is higher but it was no problem at this level (Browns at 10, stick gauge at 6.5),\nBlurry Photo of the top part of the river right channel on Slippery Hot Dog\nEddie out asap on river left after the entrance to scout super sexy slide.\nScouting Super Sexy Slide from river right (scouting from river left is easier and better)\nBottom view of Super Sexy Slide\nBlury photo of Sage running Super Sexy Slide (top half)\nBlurry Photo of Sophie running Super Sexy Slide (bottom half)\nThe river joins up and quickly drops into a ~100ft slide. There is a bit of time to deal with a swimmer before Jingle Pot Slot which consists of a slot drop on the left with undercut banks or you can run center and there is a super fun double drop.\nMidway down Jingle Pot Slot from river right\nThe center line looks manky but is quite fun. Charge left to avoid a nasty hole backed up by a big rock. To scout eddie out river right on the left hand turn after Super Sexy Slide. Next is upper entrance slide, which consists of a slide into a backed up hole, go center and charge left.\nScouting Jingle Pot Slot from river right\nThis is followed by a fun little curler boof on the left. To scout, eddie out on river right after Jinglepot Drop (just around the corner). Around the next corner is the lower entrance slide, and is not worth scouting; run center through two wave holes and then move right down a small, slidey hole thing.\nBottom view of the upper entrance slide (the entrance slides are at the end of the canyon due to a hiking in error the first time around)\nThis is the end of the canyon; from here, paddle a class II boogie rapid and then a half-hour paddle out to the take out bridge or to the ocean, where you can paddle a little further and take out right at the liquor store (49.5251663691617, -124.84815684737005).\nGeneral Notes - Be prepared for lots of prickly bushes when scouting\nAccess Considerations - To access this run, you need the gate to be opened; the hours are posted on the gate. On the weekends the gate is open from 8 am - 4 pm. The road is not bad. There is a rope set up to lower boats down.\nPut In Notes - Drive up Buckley Bay Main about 3.5 Km. There is a small turn off on the left (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ppo3pbsntG9HJPpy7). Park here and walk down the overgrown road on the left. when the road starts to bend walk into the forest to the rope (\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/6Dr72ECXNBHZGVKe7\n).\nTake out notes - Take out at the Island Highway Bridge (https://maps.app.goo.gl/PgyPsGQXMQNSZYjS6), or paddle out to the ocean and paddle to wherever you decided to park.\nVisual Gauge Notes - There is no online gauge for the Tsable. A good indicator for a medium flow is 10 -12 cms on the Browns River and dropping. It could be done lower or higher. There is also a stick gauge on river right under the Tsable River Trestle (https://maps.app.goo.gl/XtdLit7VSF7eWgeV6). Look for around 6 and a half for a medium flow.\nStick gauge under Tsable Tressle\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

It is the bread and butter whitewater run for Whitehorse locals, though it is located in the little piece of BC that separates coastal Alaska from Yukon's southern border. This river offers spectacular scenery and fantastic white water, and the higher the water, the higher the quality of the rapids.\nThe river is found along Yukon highway 2 south of Whitehorse and Carcross. There are two put in options. The most common is the trail head leading to the canyon section. Driving south on highway 2, the trailhead is approximately 1 km past the Yukon Suspension Bridge (tourist attraction) on the left. The upper and more scenic put in is 2 km past the Log Cabin Mountain parking lot, again on the left. Park in the pull out and follow the trail to the lake. This upper put in offers scenic lake paddling access to the upper beginnings of the river.\nThe take out is exactly 4 km north of the canyon put in.\nThe beginning canyon section holds 2 km of continuous class three rapids ending in a more challenging drop called The Nozzle.\nThe river then becomes more pool drop in nature, with 4 distinct rapids that are more challenging than the upper section. All rapids can be easily scouted and portaged.\nA wide view showing where the Tutshi is located relative to Whitehorse.\nThe upper put in at the lake.\nThe Nozzle.

While you're in the area, make sure to check out some of the 5 sections on the Gold River, as well as the other local creeks: Pamela, Quatchka, Heber and Upana. Look for these runs and others to be described in an upcoming guidebook produced by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nAs with many of the creeks in Gold River, a good starting point is 100cms on GOLD RIVER BELOW UCONA RIVER (08HC001), a bit less in the spring. The Ucona River can handle a wider range of flows than many of the creeks in the area. Also, the brown tannin water at the put in is a clue that this river may hold onto its flow for longer than clear water streams in the area.\n2020 hydrograph and median for GOLD RIVER BELOW UCONA RIVER (08HC001). A good starting point is ~100cms on this gauge, less in the spring.\nAccess to the Ucona River is on gravel logging roads outside of Gold River, which itself is just over an hour west of Campbell River on Highway 28. From the main junction in the town of Gold River, bear left onto Muchalat Drive, and turn left onto Ucona Main before crossing the bridge over the Gold River. Follow the Ucona Main past Star Lake for ~9km to a bridge over the Ucona River at the put in. To get to the take out, drive a further ~9km along the Ucona Main, passing over both Pamela and Quatchka Creeks, to a nondescript pullout. From here, a very rough trail leads down to a takeout on river left, and it's recommended to scout this takeout ahead of time before putting on. The trail may be hard to find without a local or a guidebook. A previously used take out on river right is no longer favoured due to deteriorating roads.\nFrom the put in, the river will look low and a bit unappetizing with the shallowness and the amount of wood. The initial section is unique as it consists of bedrock rapids, but is not in a canyon. These drops are almost all worth scouting, and while they look strange and have pin potential there is often a line. Most people will portage something in this section. After the Pamela Creek confluence, the geology changes to a clean granite read and run class IV canyon. Below this canyon is a classic double waterfall that can be scouted and portaged on the left. Once Quatchka Creek confluences just below the double drop, paddle some boogie and one more class IV pinch rapid before looking for the take out on river left. This nondescript take out needs to be scouted ahead of time, as the Lower Ucona downstream has only seen a few portage-filled descents.\nThe Ucona River at a medium level doesn't look like much at the put in, but it canyons up downstream.\nScouting a random drop in the technical section above the Pamela confluence.\nAnother random drop above the Pamela confluence.\nThe first waterfall in the classic Ucona double drop.\nThe second waterfall in the classic Ucona double drop.\nLooking back up the Ucona, Pamela, and Quatchka valleys.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

While you're in the area, make sure to check out some of the 5 sections on the Gold River, as well as the other local creeks: Heber, Ucona, Pamela, and Quatchka. Look for these runs and others to be described in an upcoming guidebook produced by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society. Also, the Upana Caves are also just a short drive further up the road beyond the put in.\nFor the Upana to be runnable, the levels on the Gold River need to be a bit higher than for the other creeks in the area. For the other creeks, a good starting point level is 100cms on the Gold River, while a springtime reading of 130cms meant a low runnable flow on the Upana. Snowmelt is rarely enough to bring the Upana in, a little rain bump will probably be necessary.\n2020 hydrograph and median for GOLD RIVER BELOW UCONA RIVER (08HC001). Flows of over 100cms on this gauge will be necessary to have a chance of the Upana running.\nAccess to the Upana is just outside of Gold River, a small town located just over an hour west of Campbell River on Highway 28. From Gold River, follow signs towards Tahsis along the Gold River Road, over a bridge over the Gold River, and turn left to reach a nearby bridge over the Upana River at the takeout. To get to the put in, continue towards Tahsis, stay right at the Y, and drive up the hill along the Head Bay Road (Tree to Sea Drive) for ~4km. Once the river is again visible from the road, just pick a good put in depending on how much of the roadside section you want to run.\nIf the river is at a low runnable level, the roadside boulder garden section is going to involve some narrow lines and rock bashing. If this roadside section looks padded, the canyon downstream is going to be spicy. After the river leaves the road, you'll eventually get to a canyon section which can feel uncomfortably blind at times, although it could probably be scouted with a lot of effort. The horizon line for the waterfall is obvious, and while it can be scouted from a distance, the easiest way out is to paddle off the lip. After the waterfall there is one more big drop and then the takeout shortly afterwards. Or, continue downstream into the Middle (II) and Lower (IV) Gold River sections.\nLining up the blind 20 footer on the Upana River.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Lots to surf!\nClass\nIII+ with one IV- easy waterfall\nScouting / Portaging\nMain falls can be inspected\nTime\n1-1.5 hours depending on your put-in choice\nWhen to Go\nSpring\nThe main waterfall of this run often catches wood, there's been a few incidents of people running the falls and being surprised by wood over the horizon line, so please inspect frequently.\nThere are also a lot of bears in this area, Grizzlies have been seen particularly around the put-in and take-out so be bear aware, be loud and stick with your friends.\nThe Upper Callaghan can be a nice warm-up before hitting up the main famous Callaghan run or extended into an adventure of itself by putting on further up.\nLevel\nUse the gauge at the Cal-Cheak Rec site used for the Main Callaghan. The Upper can be run from 0.1-0.5m on the gauge for a friendly level above 0.5m it gets tricky to stop and inspect the falls.\u00a0 Wood is always a hazard on this river, and often gets caught up at the waterfall.\nAccess\nPut-On Option A - Park at the bridge over the Callaghan, climb down the tricky steep slope and put on under the bridge, or walk up the river left trail for 5 minutes to 2 wooden benches, look for the pink flagging tape just after and follow a short walk to a small put-on above the fun canyon rapid.\nPut-On Option B - Park at Alexander Falls viewpoint carpark. Hike down an easy old logging road (10-15min walk) and put on at the confluence of the Callaghan and Madeley Creek.\nPut-On Option C - Same as above, but climb down and put on Madeley Creek, run the three drops into the Callaghan. Fun, but only if Madeley Creek has water.\nPut-On Option D -\nDrive up towards Callaghan lake and walk down to the river\nfor the Upper Upper Callaghan -- this is more of a class IV-V adventure with a big double drop. See this\ntrip report for more info\n.\nOn the River\nPutting in on Madeley Creek, there is a river-wide 10ft drop which is generally run down the middle, followed by a small drop best run either center off a little boof or hard river left, then run hard left on the 3rd down some boulder-mank into the Upper Callaghan.\nBenjy Ben finding some water on a low-water Madely Creek.\nIf it's too low, put on at the confluence and enjoy some nice boogie boulder garden run, the river canyons up a bit just before the road bridge, where the bridge put-on option is.\u00a0 It's possible to put on just above this canyon section too which gives you a fun rapid before the bridge.\nAfter the bridge there are a few small boulder rapids, then after a short distance you approach the main event of this run, a horizon line with a few options and\na danger to be aware of\n. You can get out on river right and inspect the falls, but you can't see the left line, nor can you see the sieve.\nThe falls is fairly simple point and shoot right of center, a fun intro to running waterfalls for many. The far left side (almost under the bushes) is a very fun off-angle boof into a slightly enclosed pool. It's almost impossible to scout so you'll be relying on previous beta. Something to be aware of is the just off center-left line feeds into a rather nasty sieve/siphon, in the photo below you can see wood in it. A whole paddler and boat has disappeared through this and reappeared behind the curtain of the falls. If you're running the right channel you are well away from it, but if you're going for the left channel don't eddy out in the middle, it's impossible to see from above.\nMain Falls of the Upper Callaghan, spot the wood in the Sieve, the left line is out of sight further river left.\nWood often gets caught up above, on and directly below this falls, so it's worth inspecting on river right.\nFrom the drone image below at very very low water the red circle is where the sieve is, it's hole in the shelf, an entire boat and person has gone through there twice! Thankfully both times they emerged through the waterfalls, but commit to either the left or right lines as early as possible.\nThe line options of the waterfall, the river-right three lines are easy, when taking either of the river-left lines be sure to come in from high up, a good boof is required for the hard left line.\nThe rest of the run is mostly read and run fun boulder garden, with one rapid with a larger hole which has a green tongue on the center-right side at certain levels.\nThe take out is down the right channel at a large island, (or go left if running the class IV-V section below). There is sometimes a large wood-jam blocking this channel, as of July 2022 it is clear and you can paddle down the right channel but be cautious as there is still a danger here, if it's blocked it's safer to take out just to the left of the wood-jam climb over and put back on the other side.\u00a0 A short paddle down and there's a small beach (at low flows) / creek that comes in from river right which signals the take-out. There will be some flagging tape to lead you back up to the road. If you rejoin the main flow you've gone too far and you're into the main Callaghan -- eddy out and bush-whack back up.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Usually run as things are coming down from peak runoff.\nGauge\n0.36cms\u2193 (Feb 28 22:00)\nSkip to the end to read a perfect and concise write up of all 3 Pingston sections by the true master of the Pingston, the late, great Adrian Kiernan.\nThe run starts out with really nice class 4/4+ to warm up on. Keep a sharp eye out for wood, especially on this section (summer 2019 had 3-4 pieces that required portaging). The run will start to ramp up and contains a couple of the bigger rapids (a slide with a narrow exit and highway to hell) before the middle 3rd (ish) which is the steepest section of run. The middle third is the kilometer before and the kilometer after the portage and is the most continuous part of the run, containing an amazing array of ledges with big boofs over meaty holes. Although much of this run has been aptly described as class 5 boogie, scouting is possible and highly recommended if showing yourself down for the first time. The portage canyon comes up very quickly with easier eddies on river left, but the portage itself on river right. The character of this run seems to be more forgiving than it looks, and following the water generally results in good lines.\nFlow:\nBest between 5.75 and 6 on the gauge at the dam. Find it on the river left side of the reservoir. This roughly correlates to 8-15cms on the\nCranberry Creek gauge\n.\nThis page now shows flow information directly from Pingston dam at the top, but we are still working to understand the correlation between that gauge and runnability.\nCan be run as low as 5.7, but becomes bony with more pin and sieve potential. 6 on the dam is, in the words of Garrett Quinn, \"The Super Bowl. The Stanley Cup finals. As good as it gets.\"\nHighway to Hell (photo by Erik Shore)\nStairway to Heaven (photo by Garrett Quinn)\nPut in:\nAlternate routes to the put in exist. The shortest is to use the Mt. Odin road. This extremely overgrown road was brushed in the summer of 2019 making it usable, however there are few spur roads and staying on the right road may require doing some research (using google earth or similar) before you go. The longer but less confusing route to the put in involves taking the turn close to where the penstock, or pipe of water diverted from the Pingston, crosses the road. If you are coming from the main road it is a right turn just before the gated private access road to the Trans Alta powerhouse (if you are coming from the takeout it is a left turn). I would strongly recommend a\nB.C. Backroads Mapbook\nor using Google maps in satellite mode, and downloading the directions/maps before you go in order to avoid frustration and faff. It is easy to see the put in, take out and the roads that lead there in satellite mode.\nGoogle Maps Directions\nTake Out:\nTravelling from Revelstoke. Head towards Arrow Lakes ferry on Highway 23, Turn right onto Shelter Bay FSR (go for~ 16.5km), Turn right onto Limekiln rd and follow it\u00a0 (~ 6.5km) until you cross the bridge over the Pingston which serves as the upper takeout or middle put in.\nGoogle Maps Directions\nAdrian's write up:\nMy Pingston schooling is finally complete!\nPaddled the middle and lower section of Pingston creek today finishing in Arrow lake.\nMIDDLE - There were a couple of pieces of wood in the middle, they are in the steeper \"class 5\"(not really) section right towards the end at the bridge. when you see the floating boys hanging in the trees on river right (cant miss them) your getting close so keep a look out.\n(this section would go way higher (class 4+/5) and lower (3/4)\nLOWER - good to go at these flows but a little burly for the 60ft combo. needs to be a bit lower but not much. portage right from the pool on the lip and include the major rapid downstream. UGLY\nI guess flows would have been around .70 -.75 at the upper dam gauge.\nA todo at these flows is definitely possible. It took us 2 hours from middle put in to lake our first time. we barely scouted anything till the \"class 5\" bit before the bridge. but we did virtually every corner from there to the lake.\nUPPER - Good to go from .7(boney as hell but fun) to (best guess) 1m (very scary)\nBest flows between .75 and .9 to show yourself down.\nTime: anywhere between 6 hours to 45 mins if you know the lines!\nPortage right!!!\nFor more information check out Mikkel's series of 5\nblog posts\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

      "full_text": "BCWhitewater\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nAbout\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact\nBecome a member\nUpper Tulameen\nContributed by Cam Fenton\nWhat It's Like\nRemote, wilderness feel; low-volume canyons\nClass\nIII-V\nScouting / Portaging\nEverything is scoutable and/or portageable, but some portages are steep and brushy.\nTime\n2-3 days for the full run, 3-5 hours per section.\nWhen to Go\nMay - June\nGauge\n0.708cms\u2193 (Oct 21 04:45)\n!\nWith files from Scott McBride.\nThe Tulameen River above the normal run has a number of runnable low volume class III-V canyons with a wilderness feel, but FSR or trail access is always nearby. Get a backroads map, hike or drive in, and explore this rarely paddled BC roadside river. Wild camping and historical mining debris are found throughout the region. This zone is about 4 hours drive from Vancouver, and can be accessed by forest service roads from either Princeton on Highway 3, or the Britton rest area on Highway 5 (or by hiking from Manning Park if you're motivated). The flow window will only last a month or so in the late spring, similar to the Ashnola.\nAlpine - Tulameen Campsite to Horseguard Camp. Class II/III (V). Hike in section. ~10km\nLevels & Gauge: It\u2019s not clear if the gauges further downstream correlate directly with this segment since it is so far above any of them. That being said, the best window for this section is likely after the peak run-off has started to drop. Too early and you could be dealing with snow or high, pushy water in a very woody section of river. Too late and it may get too low.\u00a0 Late May or June is likely the window, depending on the snow pack and temperatures. This region has a thin snowpack, and by July the melt will be done.\nHistorical flow data for the Tulameen River below Vuich Creek. 8cms will be a bare minimum, 15-20cms medium, and 30cms pretty high. Note that this gauge is on the Upper Tulameen section, while many paddlers are more familiar with the gauge Tulameen River at Princeton, which is at the takeout of the Lower (Classic) Tulameen and usually has at least twice as much flow as the upper gauge.\nThe 15km hike in.\nPutting in at Tulameen Campsite.\nDescription:\u00a0 Hike the Dewdney Trail into Tulameen Camp (about 15km) and put in on a low volume alpine creek that starts meandering through meadows with amazing views of Snass Peak and the surrounding mountains. Eventually, the river picks up speed and becomes a low volume, Class II/III creek with intermittent breaks in a few more meadows. Be on the lookout for a lot of wood in this section with many river wide logs blocking the narrow creek and a few beaver dams obstructing the flow. The crux of this section is a short canyon where Holding Creek enters the Tulameen. Two fun, clean Class III-IV entrance rapids lead into wood-choked class V rapid; in 2021 a massive piece of wood sat dead center of the runnable line and doesn\u2019t appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. Portage river right either above the entrance rapids, or just below them if you\u2019re confident running the entrance. Below this, the river widens and continues with Class II/III rapids to Horseguard Camp. There\u2019s a bridge shortly below this canyon that could provide quick access to scout the canyon or an alternate takeout.\nEntrance rapids to the Holding Creek Canyon.\nPortaging the woody Class V drop.\nFalls - Horseguard Camp to Champion FSR Bridge Class II/III (P) ~15km\nLevels & Gauge: This section hasn\u2019t been run enough to have a 100% certainty in the gauge and level, but around 15 cms on the BELOW VUICH CREEK gauge seems to be a good medium-low level.\nLooking up at Tulameen Falls.\nAbove the falls.\nDescription: A large campsite on the HBC brigade trail, Horseguard Camp provides easy beach access to the river and higher flows just below the confluence with Podunk Creek. The river quickly winds through classic Class II/III boogie water to the crux portage above Tulameen Falls. You know you\u2019re getting close when you have to portage a massive log jam covering an entire island in a left hand river cover. Portage river left from the last beach on your left above the falls. Aim straight up towards a logging road on a ridge above and descend northeast off the nose of the ridge towards the Tulameen Falls trail. Hike upstream to put back in just below the falls. Below the falls, the river picks up a bit in a series of fun Class III pool drop rapids and Class II boogie water. Vuich Creek enters from river left, and has a runnable falls further upstream near the FSR.\nFalls on Vuich Creek - Photo by Scott McBride.\nTulameen Falls - Photo by Scott McBride.\nChampion/Lodestone FSR Bridge to Olivine FSR Bridge Class III-IV (V+) ~5km\nLevels & Gauge: Again, this section hasn\u2019t been run enough to have a 100% certainty in the gauge and level. This stretch is a fun medium low between 8-15 cms on the BELOW VUICH CREEK gauge. Below this some of the more open sections might get too low, above it, expect the canyons to get pushier.\nThe first fun III-IV canyon. Photo by Scott McBride.\nBelow the III/IV Canyon.\nFun class III leads into a beautiful Class III/IV canyon full of amazing, clean rapids. At medium to low levels, all the rapids have large recovery pools below, but could get more challenging at higher flows. Near the end of the canyon is a stout riverwide hole, and after a short open section, this is followed by a less runnable Class V (+?) constriction drop. Both drops can be portaged river right up and down some steep embankments. It may be possible to seal launch back into the canyon below the crux drop on river right, which would avoid a tiresome brushy portage. Wood could also become an issue in this canyon, so keep your head up.\nStout hole near the end of the first canyon at medium-high flows. Photo by Scott McBride.\nClass V+ constriction at the end of the first canyon. Photo by Scott McBride.\nOlivine FSR to Tulameen Town (III-V) ~15km\nLevels & Gauge: Again, this section hasn\u2019t been run enough to have a 100% certainty in the gauge and level. This stretch is a fun medium low between 8-15 cms on the BELOW VUICH CREEK gauge. Below this and some of the rapids might get a little boney, above it, expect the rapids to get pushier and eddies to start to disappear.\nScenic Class III.\nApproach to the second canyon at low water. Photo by Scott McBride.\nScenic Class III leads into a narrow Class V canyon about 1km below Illal/Britton Creek. Scouting and portaging this canyon is probably challenging at medium to high water. At low water, you can scout and portage at river level on river right, or portage along a flagged trail river left that takes you up to the Tulameen FSR. Look for pink flagging tape that directs you downstream, and orange flagging tape that climbs up towards the road. About 100m down the road, an old logging road descends right back to the river just below the crux and 200m upstream of an old cable car that runs above the river. From here it\u2019s more pool drop Class III/IV until you hit another Class IV rapid with some serious wood hazard below a bridge (note, neither this bridge nor the roads serving it show up GPS or satellite images).\nThe second canyon. Photo by Scott McBride.\nClass V crux of the second canyon. Photo by Scott McBride.\nLawless Creek confluences river left, but this area is private property and the creek itself is not worth paddling. Below this it\u2019s more Class II-III until the valley opens up and the river eases towards the town of Tulameen. It\u2019s mostly easy from here down, but one Class III rapid remains in a river right channel between two high banks. If it\u2019s open, you can get food and beer at the Tulameen Trading Post.\nAttempting the second canyon at anything but low water will have some exciting blind corners. Photo by Scott McBride.\nClass  IV rapid at the \"halfway bridge\" the last bridge before Tulameen. After this, the river eases to Class II-III. Photo by Scott McBride.\nClassic/Lower - Tulameen to Princeton - II+ (IV) 28km (21km from Coalmont) (With files from Claudia Schwab)\nLevels & Gauge: Runnable across a wide range of levels, around 80cms on the Princeton gauge is considered high. Still fun at lower levels around 15-20 cms.\nMostly a float with some Class II boogie water. The only major rapid is called either Tulameanie Drop, Tulameen Falls or Tunnel Rapid (depending on who you ask) but it\u2019s all the same Class IV rapid with a Class III lead in section. Can be scouted at river level, or by hiking up to the KVR rail trail on river left, the rail trail also makes an easy portage. Take out on river right just past the Bridge of Dreams pedestrian bridge in Two Rivers Park. A new brewery is expected to open within walking distance of the takeout in 2022.\nGranite Creek, which confluences river right below Coalmont, has some nice canyons but also a VERY dangerous mining adit in the river and is not recommended.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Hidden way up the White River Main is a nicely packaged short canyon section with flood sculpted overhanging walls, similar to Seymour Canyon on the mainland. Depending on levels, you can either lap the canyon, carry on down the Upper (III-IV (P)) and Lower White (III) to Sayward Junction, or hit up the other quality runs in the area such as the Adam (III+) and Middle Memekay (III-IV). Look for these runs and others to be described in an upcoming guidebook produced by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nFlows\nThere is no online gauge on the White River, but the gauge on the Salmon River near Sayward can help to estimate flows. Appropriate flows happen in the days following rain events in the fall and winter, and more consistently during spring snowmelt. A minimum flow is 50cms on this gauge. At these flows, the White River Canyon is a pool drop class IV section with ample time to catch eddies and scout rapids. Anything over 100cms is getting high, and the river rapidly changes into a class V boily continuous section where scouting and portaging may not always be an option. Keep in mind that the White River is only one of many tributaries to the Salmon River, on which the gauge is located. Also, a certain cms reading may feel higher during snowmelt season, when more water comes from higher up the drainage where the canyon is located. Finally, the riverbed at the put in and takeout is quite wide, while the canyon itself is very tight in places. Judgement is required; if there is a surf wave at the takeout, maybe you should be thinking twice about dropping into a box canyon.\n2020 hydrograph and median flows for the Salmon River at Sayward. A guideline is 50-100cms on this gauge as a starting point for good flows in the White River canyon.\nShuttle\nThe takeout is found just over an hour north from Campbell River, by following Highway 19 to Sayward Junction, turning left across from the gas station, doing a little zig zag to find the start of the White River Main which begins with a steep hill, and following this up the river right side of the White River for ~18km to a bridge at the take out (avoid Victoria Main). The put in is ~4.5km further upstream on river left. Once the road gets close to the river again, look for a fisherman's trail down to a rock ledge next to the water. If you hit White River Provincial Park, you've gone too far. Expect to encounter loaded logging trucks, which have the right of way.\nOn the water\nAfter a warm up over some gravel bars, the river quickly canyons up into a boat scoutable class IV rapid. The first major rapid follows shortly after, which is a double drop that is scouted on the right. After, the river forms a committing tube which curves to the right, leading safely to an eddy to scout the second major rapid: a broken ledge boofed or seal launched on the right. The third drop can only be partially scouted, by swimming to a boulder on river left. After checking for wood, the line is just to drop in and hold on through a series of curlers and holes, in what is arguably the crux rapid. A section of fun read and run boogie leads to a riverwide ledge. All that remains is the twisting exit to the canyon, which can be tricky to scout but always gets run anyhow. Easy water quickly brings the takeout bridge, and another lap.\nThe entry to the first major rapid.

A rough minimum flow to consider the Lower White is 50cms on the Salmon River at Sayward gauge, but 100cms will be a more enjoyable medium level. Local whitewater canoeists have a visual staff gauge at the White River Campground, on which the red zone indicates their preferred range.

The difficulty of the whitewater is comparable to the Nass.\nFlows\nThe White flows all summer, and likely correlates with the Nass gauge. It is not a small river, as it contributes a decent portion of the Nass directly from the massive Cambria Icefield. High water could get too boily. Information for this description is based on flows of 700cms in September (NASS RIVER ABOVE SHUMAL CREEK 08DB001).\nShuttle\nThe run is located near Meziadin Lake on Highway 37 north of Terrace. There are two takeout options: a lower option at the normal Nass day section takeout at the Arbor FSR bridge, and an upper unmarked option along Highway 37 just north of Moore Creek.\nThe put in should be reached by continuing north, crossing the Nass River on the Meziadin Bridge, and turning left onto Meziadin FSR. Cross the old airstrip and the Meziadin River, then and continue for 16km to the put in at a bridge over the White River.\nAfter finishing paddling, the Meziadin River fish ladders are nearby and are worth checking out.\nOn the water\nThe run starts right away with a boily, read and run, low gradient, class III-IV open canyon, which continues for several kilometers. Somewhere in this first section on a right turn is a pinch rapid that is a bit gross, at normal flows it can be portaged on slabs on river left.\nThen the river gradually opens up and mellows out to class II for several kilometers. About 1km before the Nass confluence, there is an easy pinch on a sharp left turn. From this pinch down to the Nass are a couple technical class IV rapids.\nImmediately after the confluence is a sizeable class IV rapid on the Nass. After this rapid look for a waterfall on river left of the Nass (Moore Creek). This is one takeout option, a steep 500m bushwhack out to the highway that is pretty thick but doable. Or, continue downstream on the Nass for more class III-IV rapids down to the normal takeout at the Arbor FSR bridge.\nIn total, the paddle is about 15km on the White River and an additional optional 20km on the Nass River.\nMeziadin FSR bridge over the White River at the put in.\nLooking downstream from the put in bridge on the White River.\nA gross pinch rapid in the first canyon.\nTechnical class IV just above the Nass confluence.\nConfluence of White (bottom) and Nass (left to right) Rivers.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

The main reasons to paddle this section are to link together the full White at low flows, or to tick the portage drop off your list. The portage canyon is totally runnable at the right flows (low), it is marked as a portage here so that it is taken seriously. Paddling the full White makes for a nice day of boating finishing at Sayward Junction: Canyon (IV-V), Upper (III-IV (P)), and Lower (III). While you're in the area, hit up the other quality runs such as the Adam (III+) and Middle Memekay (III-IV). Look for these runs and others to be described in an upcoming guidebook produced by the Vancouver Island Whitewater Paddling Society.\nThere is no online gauge on the White River, but the gauge on the Salmon River near Sayward can help to estimate flows. To consider paddling the Upper White, the White River Canyon should be on the low side, which means probably not much more than 50cms on the Salmon River at Sayward gauge.\nThe takeout is found just over an hour north from Campbell River, by following Highway 19 to Sayward Junction, turning left across from the gas station, doing a little zig zag to find the start of the White River Main which begins with a steep hill, and following this up the river right side of the White River for ~12km to a small pullout and quarry on the left. Across the road, there is a steep fisherman's trail down to the water. It's strongly recommended to hike in to the takeout ahead of time to scout the last rapid before committing to this run. Take the takeout trail partway down, then follow a forested bench upstream on river right and try to get a glimpse down into the canyon. The put in is ~6km further upstream at a bridge over the White River (avoid Victoria Main). Expect to encounter loaded logging trucks, which have the right of way.\nFrom the put in bridge, the paddling is read and run class III with both boulders and some wide bedrock shelves. Gradually, the ledges get a bit taller and more complex, catching out the inattentive boater. Where the canyon tightens up, stay on your toes and look for a beefy riverwide ledge above a narrow canyon, often full of wood. This is the portage rapid, and to portage it the whole canyon must be portaged, probably easier on the left. Don't overcommit. If you are considering running the portage canyon, you should have scouted the hazards beforehand, which include but are not limited to: a beefy entry ledge, a very deep cave river left, many old growth logs, and a terminal eddy at the bottom right. Below the portage, the steep take out trail is immediately on river right, but it is recommended just to continue down the Lower White (III) to Sayward Junction.\nA downstream view from the put in bridge at a reasonable low level to consider paddling the Upper White.\nAssessing the caves from the canyon rim.\nThe exit of the crux canyon.\nDon't even consider paddling this section at high water.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

Quick when you know the run.\nWhen to Go\nEarly season snowmelt and/or after rain.\nGauge\n80.7cms\u2191 (Oct 21 06:00)\n!\nWilliams Creek is a fantastic river in Terrace that serves as the local after work classic when you want to go river running. Located just a few minutes from the center of town, this river flows out of the mountains into the Skeena, carving a beautiful valley through coastal forest with smooth granite and clear water of exceedingly high quality. Aside from being the bread and butter run for the locals, and it's a must do for anyone who's in that zone when the water is flowing.\nGenerally speaking, most of the rivers close to Terrace flow best from snowmelt in the spring and early summer, and Williams is no exception. Unless there's a ton of snow, July is usually getting pretty late to catch it with water. It will also run from rain throughout the year, but the northerly location tends to shut it down for the winter even though Terrace is close to the coast. There is a visual gauge at the take out. 0.3 to 0.5 is a a good low through high range preferred by the local crowd.\nGauge under the bridge at the take out\nWilliams is found south of Terrace, about 10 minutes from town. The take out is at a bridge over the river on Old Lakelse Lake Drive, which intersects with highway 16 east of Terrace. Follow this road south for about 12 km until it crosses the river. There's a large parking area on river left downstream of the bridge. The put in is up the river right logging road. The most obvious put in (Middle Williams) is at a bridge over the river, found down a short spur off the logging main about 7 km in. There is a short section above this called the Race Course, accessed by going about 1 km further upstream where there is a good but hard to find trail right off the road down to the water. There is also river access at the start and the end of the significant whitewater, letting you customize your Williams experience depending on the group and water level.\nAt the Race Course put in, the river is mellow, but quickly picks up to fun class III-IV read and run down to and past the road bridge put in. It mellows for a while below here until you get to the first rapid, a small ledge called Toothache that has a big hole at high flow. Ledges of smooth granite and long boulder slaloms come in quick succession after here for a few km through the meat of the run, with most places having relatively easy scouting and portaging. After the last rapids, it takes around half an hour to paddle all the way out to the road.\nForest at the take out.\nThick coastal forest in the Williams valley.\nThe steep trail down to the put in of the Racecourse section.\nwilliams5.jpg\n227 KB\nRacecourse\nToothache\nNon stop action\nMeat grinder\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",

More intimidating and consequential than it is technically difficult, the Yoho's frigid, chalky-white water contains dozens of class 4 moves back to back to back and enough small eddies to catch your breath and warm up your hands in. The inaccessible nature of the canyon, continuous nature of the whitewater and must-run crux puts this run solidly in the class 5 range despite most individual moves feeling more like 4/4+. Numerous stories of Heli-evacuations and heinous swims add to the lore that surrounds this river and the respect with which it is treated.\nTakkakaw Falls (Photo by Rich Kemble)\nStarting off at the base of Takakkaw falls the Yoho meanders down some class 2 for a kilometer or so before the pace picks up. The river narrows and the gradient increases which creates a style of whitewater best characterized by lots of strong currents and reactionaries to keep your nose on top of and ride. Shortly after a narrow gap with a slight undercut on the left come 3 Deuces. 3 Deuces has multiple lines at different flows, but all are fairly narrow and worth having a look at, especially if you are not familiar with it or are checking for wood.\n3 Deuces (Photo by Garrett Quinn)\nA handful of really nice rapids later comes another narrow gap with a big eddy on the left just after it. The sunshine eddy. Since the Yoho is most often run in the morning at the low point in it's diurnal fluctuation and the canyon walls are so high, this happens to be one of the few places where sunshine reaches the river. This eddy is a great place to warm up the hands, especially since the crux, Pandora's Box, is not too far downstream. A couple of nice moves and one of the best boofs on the river separate the sunshine eddy from the scout eddy for Pandora's. It is a small eddy (2 boats max) on river right. Pandora's is a few hundred meters long and can only be partially scouted. The big, flat-topped rock in the middle near the bottom of the rapid is a bit undercut and the channel to the left of it is also undercut/has an overhanging wall that has been responsible for at least 1 heli-evac. Too far away from the scout to see properly, but just upstream of the flat-topped rock is a large hole that angles and pushes towards the rock. The ideal line is to stay right of the big, flat-topped rock.\nScouting Pandora's (Photo by Rich Kemble)\nThe next major rapid after Pandora's is the Keep, a 6-8 foot ledge that is most vertical drop on the river and should be run on the right. Immediately after the Keep comes Tunnel of Love (possibly \"Tunnel of Fear\" according to Stuart Smith's guidebook), a long, narrow hallway that beautifully frames Castle Mountain in the background. From here to the takeout is more Yoho goodness with too many boofs, eddies and rapids to name.\nFlows:\nThere is a gauge located just before the hairpin switchbacks on the road to Takakkaw falls. Normal runnable flows are from 20 to 13 holes showing on the post that the gauges keep getting ripped off of. It does channelize quite well so could definitely be run lower.\nHigh flows make for some very continuous whitewater and are most enjoyable when you already know the lines.\nA rough correlation can be found online by using the Kicking Horse gauge where flows around 60-80 cms are a good indication that the Yoho could be in, however a lot of tributaries enter below the Yoho. The Yoho is fed by fairly high elevation snowmelt. This means that even if the Kicking Horse is quite a bit higher than 80 cms, cold weather up high could have the Yoho at prime flows.\nDue to the fact that it is fed by snowmelt, hot weather can bring the river up quickly. The low point in the day seems to be somewhere between 6 and 10 A.M. with most days not seeing a dramatic increase in flow until after 12:00 noon. Be warned though that the river can rise quickly on a hot day and late-morning laps that run into problems can have those problems compounded by quickly rising levels.\nEvening laps, especially on cold days in the summer, or warm days in the fall can be glorious.\nPut in: Parking lot at the base of Takkakaw Falls\nTake out: A small pullout a few hundred meters before the switchbacks on the road to Takkakaw Falls\nP.S. Buy a park pass. Support Parks and if you get stuck in the canyon you don't have to pay for the Helicopter rescue.\nBC Whitewater\nProudly founded in 2018.\nBecome a Member\nProjects\nRivers\nGet Involved\nOur Team\nPartners\nContact",
